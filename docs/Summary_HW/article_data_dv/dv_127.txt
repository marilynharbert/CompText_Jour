Full text: Â  A coalition consisting of the Human Rights Campaign, the GLBTQ Domestic Violence Project, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP), FORGE and the National Center for Transgender Equality issued a statement applauding "the Department of Justice for issuing strong implementing guidelines for the historic non-discrimination provisions in the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)."
The statement adds that the guidelines guarantee "that LGBT survivors of violence receive equal services and treatment free from unlawful discrimination. ... These provisions mark the first ever explicit protections from discrimination for LGBT people under federal law."
The coalition also announced that "the Office of Violence Against Women in the Department of Justice (OVW) announced a framework for analyzing the Limited conditions for services that are segregated or specific to gender and prohibited justifications based on overbroad assumptions or past practice." Lastly, the group urged other federal agencies to follow "the Lead of the Department of Justice and [apply] similar interpretations of other Laws and regulations prohibiting discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.
