Do they let you tell them what the violence is? Do they let you tell them how you identify?

"357","dv_8.txt","Abstract: Dati said the assault also led to more abusive situations, including the one with his first male partner. In 2014, he wrote his memoir, I Am Me, detailing the abuse he endured and its impacts and he began doing public speaking engagements to talk about his experiences. Dati, who lives in Chicago, regularly speaks to youth at the Center on Halstead and has previously led discussions with the Chicago Police Department on intimate partner violence and how it uniquely impacts men and LGBT victims. Denise Brown, eldest sister of the late Nicole Brown Simpson, formed The Elite Speakers Bureau in 2010 to bring awareness and provide education on domestic violence, school safety, child abuse, teen violence, elder abuse, stalking, net crimes, workplace violence, victims of crime, sexual assault, mental health & wellness and more.

"663","dv_13.txt","-Wealthy progressives, and anyone with disposable income, need to step up to the plate more than they ever have. They need to look beyond their social circles, and typical nonprofits they back, to a long list of social justice and social service groups. Get out of your comfort zone and give money to the Fight for $15, to Black Lives Matter, BYP100, the Immigrant Youth Justice League, Pride Action Tank, SEIU Healthcare, Planned Parenthood, Chicago Survivors, domestic violence and homeless groups, among many others. There will also be new groups, such as Rise Movement-explore, explore, explore, for the new and innovative, and the tried and true.",13,NA,"Love and violence in Black LGBTQ communities",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_13.txt"
"664","dv_13.txt","-Politics is both national and local. The Democratic Party has always felt like a factory system, where you ""do your time"" and you get rewarded with that next open seat. That process has not created a deep pool of candidates that can speak to the people, and crush the gerrymandering attempts of the GOP. To ""rise up"" the party must have a better way to allow for innovation, for charismatic, passionate candidates and leadership who don't play by the old rules, who can attract new voters and bring life back into the party.",13,NA,"Love and violence in Black LGBTQ communities",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_13.txt"
"665","dv_13.txt","-The relatively new tools of social media can be exploited in great ways to help social-justice and social-service groups. We have not done a good job of coalition building in the past because each group often is very proprietary of their connections to money and other assets. This has to stop. No one is asking for the massive institutions to give away their email lists. But wouldn't it be great for the institutions to work together to better cross promote events and needs to lesser-resourced groups?",13,NA,"Love and violence in Black LGBTQ communities",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_13.txt"
"666","dv_13.txt","Here are some examples. The Women's March on Chicago and the Illinois delegation to D.C. have large social media followings. In addition, many groups supported these efforts, and they each have followings on social media. A cross-promotion of fundraising could happen for the groups. Yes, there would be limitations based on some groups being non-partisan, but I am mainly talking about social justice groups and services, not candidates and political action committees.",13,NA,"Love and violence in Black LGBTQ communities",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_13.txt"
"667","dv_13.txt","So, here is how it could work. Each week, for 52 weeks a year, every partner group agrees to promote an online fundraising campaign for the selected social justice groups that week. The emphasis being on smaller groups (maybe one large and two small social justice groups each week). In addition, everyone would agree to post a list of actions happening among these groups, to all of their social media channels. This could be an anti-violence or immigration-rights protest, or a march in front of a religious institution that has been vandalized, or a push for a responsible budget in Illinois. Partners could ""opt out"" if the action violates their nonprofit status.",13,NA,"Love and violence in Black LGBTQ communities",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_13.txt"
"668","dv_13.txt","Why should larger and smaller groups do this, when it might cut into their own efforts? First, I believe firmly that when you help others you help yourself. That is true for individuals, businesses and nonprofits. When I see Planned Parenthood or Lambda Legal helping others, or working in coalition, I am much more likely to support them. Second, we are in a time now where we must lift all boats. All means all. If funds are being cut to all domestic violence services in Illinois, we need a statewide call to action and fundraising. Same for youth homeless services. And for acting up when there is a police shooting against an unarmed young African-American on Chicago's South Side.",13,NA,"Love and violence in Black LGBTQ communities",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_13.txt"

During the battle for LGBTQ rights, corporate allies have played an increasing role of support, and clout. They have helped fight against anti-LGBTQ legislation, some going so far as to boycott cities and states doing bad deeds. They must now look to expand this social justice mission to other areas where they can have influence-which is almost everywhere. Now that corporations are ""people,"" they have a much louder voice in politics, and we as consumers can pressure them to use that voice for good (while at the same time fighting the notion that they are people!).

"671","dv_13.txt","-Some religious organizations have always been social justice-oriented.

"1032","dv_16.txt","""Sexual abuse is a difficult topic for anyone to talk about. It evokes a lot of fear, confusion, anger, and shame-a potent mix that helps keep the topic out of our daily conversations. But sadly, abuse is part of our everyday world,"" Research Psychologist Dr. Nina Burrowes said. ""It's a statistical inevitability that all of us have people in our lives who have experienced abuse-especially within the LGBT community. Research data tells us that members of our community are more likely to report that they have experienced abuse. So it's essential that the LGBT community talks about it more.""",16,NA,"Letters to the editor",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_16.txt"
"1033","dv_16.txt","The inevitable question is: ""Why?""",16,NA,"Letters to the editor",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_16.txt"
"1034","dv_16.txt","""There are a few different theories. Most people are abused by men. For some people this can lead to a massive mistrust of men that prevents them from feeling safe enough to enter into a relationship with any man, and so they only form relationships with women,"" Burrowes explained. ""I'm sure this is true for some women in the LGBT community, but I don't think it fully explains the data, especially as it doesn't help to explain why men in the LGBT community also tend to report higher levels of abuse.""",16,NA,"Letters to the editor",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_16.txt"
"1035","dv_16.txt","Another theory involves the coming-out process.",16,NA,"Letters to the editor",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_16.txt"
"1036","dv_16.txt","""An alternative theory is about the process of coming out as a lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. Many people who have experienced abuse repress, deny or minimize the experience to themselves. And so when they are filling in a survey they may not report the abuse as abuse-either because they are afraid of what people will think of them or because they are still not admitting the truth to themselves,"" Burrowes said. ""It's possible that people who are comfortable stating that they are LGBT in surveys are also more likely to recognize that they have been abused and feel comfortable enough to disclose this on the survey.""",16,NA,"Letters to the editor",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_16.txt"
"1037","dv_16.txt","Becoming a potential target is another rationale.",16,NA,"Letters to the editor",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_16.txt"
"1038","dv_16.txt","""Of course the most uncomfortable reason for the increased reporting of abuse within the LGBT community is that we could be the target of abuse-either because people are living in higher risk situations because they have been excluded from their own communities, because some abusers may specifically target the LGBT community, and because there are also abusers within our community,"" Burrowes said.",16,NA,"Letters to the editor",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_16.txt"
"1039","dv_16.txt","The abused are often silent witnesses to a crime that no one even knows exists.",16,NA,"Letters to the editor",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_16.txt"
"1040","dv_16.txt","""We have ideas in our head about abusers and abuse. We talk about men targeting children in playgrounds and strangers in alleyways. When you have an experience of abuse that is at the hands of someone you trusted, it can be very confusing,"" Burrowes said. ""It can feel easier to blame yourself or dismiss what happened. We know that many people don't report the crimes to the police, but I believe that many people never tell anyone about what happened.""",16,NA,"Letters to the editor",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_16.txt"
"1041","dv_16.txt","Often those who do tell another person or the authorities about the abuse are reprimanded themselves.",16,NA,"Letters to the editor",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_16.txt"
"1042","dv_16.txt","""A common reaction to someone who is in an abusive relationship is, 'Why don't you just leave?' This feels like the common sense thing to do, but often the situation is a lot more complex than that. An abuser can dominate every aspect of your life-the abuse can be physical, sexual, emotional, financial. Leaving can be a long process that requires a lot of support,"" Burrowes explained.",16,NA,"Letters to the editor",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_16.txt"
"1043","dv_16.txt","With the increase of acceptance regarding LGBT relationships with marriage laws, adoption rights and such, have statistics shown any decrease in domestic violence?",16,NA,"Letters to the editor",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_16.txt"
"1044","dv_16.txt","""Sadly, no. I don't see any connection between the legal status of your relationship and domestic violence,"" Burrowes said. ""Heterosexual couples have had these legal rights for years and they have been abusing each other for just as long. However, the changes may mean that there is more legal power and financial rights for anyone who is looking to leave an abusive relationship.""",16,NA,"Letters to the editor",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_16.txt"
"1045","dv_16.txt","No one is immune in helping to stop the cycle of abuse, according to Burrowes. ""I think it's important that we engage all generations on this issue-from our elders down to our toddlers. It's important that young people are aware of the laws around consent and abuse. But it's more important that we help them learn about relationships, sex, love, respect, and body choice. Relationships and sex can be beautiful, but they are also extremely challenging. You can feel vulnerable, worried about your body, worried about pleasing your partner, scared about rejection, scared about commitment. We're psychologically as well as physically naked during sex and intimacy. We need to help young people live with these vulnerabilities and challenges rather than only focusing on the laws and avoiding sexually transmitted diseases.""",16,NA,"Letters to the editor",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_16.txt"

"1047","dv_16.txt","""I wanted to use [The Courage to be Me] to reach out the person who has never talked to anyone about their abuse-the person who isn't ready to phone a helpline or get counseling,"" Burrowes shared. ""This book is my way of gently explaining some of the psychology about abuse and illustrating the fact that you're not alone and you're not broken.""",16,NA,"Letters to the editor",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_16.txt"

"1181","dv_19.txt","TuaoLo discusses an incident of physicaL violence that took place with his intimate partner: ""I got into an argument/fight with my boyfriend at the time. Things escalated and we got into a fight for personaL reasons."" TuaoLo then provides his opinion that domestic-violence response systems are designed ""to protect women or weaker people from an abusive boyfriend, husband, or stronger person who constantLy beats them up, but in this case, it was two men who got into a fight.""",19,NA,"calendar Q",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_19.txt"
"1182","dv_19.txt","We are disturbed by TuaoLo's comments and even more disturbed that they are widely accepted. There are many probLems with TuaoLo's statements, which we would Like to parse in order to provide education and work to promote healing for individuals and communities struggling around domestic/intimate partner violence.",19,NA,"calendar Q",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_19.txt"
"1183","dv_19.txt","For one, TuaoLo cannot get away with thinking that his is not a case of intimate partner violence [IPV] (also caLLed domestic violence [DV]), aLthough we may not know about the existence of a pattern. According to the NationaL Coalition of Anti-VioLence Programs, domestic vioLence is defined as a pattern of behaviors utilized by one partner (often LabeLed the ""abuser"" or ""batterer"") to exert and maintain controL over their partner(s) (the survivor(s) or victim(s)).",19,NA,"calendar Q",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_19.txt"
"1184","dv_19.txt","Domestic violence is a widespread probLem. Statistics show that domestic vioLence occurs regardless of gender identity and sexuaL orientation, with studies suggesting that LGBTQ peopLe may even be at a higher risk for abuse compared to the one in four heterosexual· women who are abused by partners during their Lives. TuaoLo attempts to normalize, condone and/or excuse the vioLence he perpetrated by rhetoricaLLy separating his actions aLong seLf-perceived gender Lines while diminishing the dynamics of an intimate partnership: ""women or weaker peopLe"" are the abused and the ""boyfriend, husband, or stronger person"" does the beating, and Let's forget the part about ""boyfriend"". ..now it's just ""two men"" who ""got into a fight."" And to top it off, there is the perception that there are no services for him and/or his boyfriend to end violence in their relationship: ""men,"" it would seem, don't need to be ""protected].""",19,NA,"calendar Q",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_19.txt"
"1185","dv_19.txt","We know from our work, from our Lives and from our colleagues around the nation engaged in similar anti-violence efforts both against and within the LGBTQ community, that aLL peopLe regardless of gender identity and/or expression, sexuaL orientation, body-size, financial privilege, race, ethnicity, age, etc. may have problems with power and controL dynamics in an intimate partnership, as a perpetrator and as a survivor. If we have Learned anything as a community, Let it be to work against stereotypes that siLence those who are marginaLized and chaLLenge systems of oppression.",19,NA,"calendar Q",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_19.txt"
"1186","dv_19.txt","VioLence is not reducible to stereotypes, neither are the vieti m /survivors and perpetrators. SeLf-identified and cuLturaLLy perceived ""twinks"" can beat up, staLk, rape and murder their seLfidentified and cuLturaLLy perceived ""big muscLe daddy"" boyfriends. Self-identified and cuLturaLLy perceived ""girLy-girl femme Lesbians"" can do the same to their partners, even if their partners identify as butch/masculine/maLe. Likewise, if two partners who seem to be of similar physicaL ability chose to use violence against each other, that vioLence does not magicalLy canceL itself out. It is not excusabLe. It is not ""male."" And it shouLd not be eroticized or fetishized by others.",19,NA,"calendar Q",NA,"../Summary_HW/article_data_dv/dv_19.txt"
"1187","dv_19.txt","UnfortunateLy for members of the LGBTQ community, there are far fewer resources and more barriers to services (both rea L and perceived). There may be greater fear of trusting Law enforcement, there are no DV sheLter beds for maLes in Chicago, and there are fewer DV/IPV support services that work with the LGBTQ community. It takes a community to advance heaLing around the issues presented in TuaoLo's interview. CaLL out vioLence where you see violence; advocate for funding to support anti-vioLence programs such as the one at Center on HaLsted; and reach out if you are struggling around power and controL dynamics in your relationship. CaLL the Center on HaLsted Anti-Violence Project at 773-8712273 (CARE) to attend to safety needs and get linked to resources. Remember, the estimates are one in four.
