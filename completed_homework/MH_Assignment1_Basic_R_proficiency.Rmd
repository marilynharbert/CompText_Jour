## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#loading the libraries
library(rio)
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)

```

## Rubric
Create an R markdown document with the following:

--Load the data: https://github.com/wellsdata/CompText_Jour/blob/main/data/blackindex_master.csv

--Using code, describe the number of rows and columns in the dataset

--Create a table that displays a count of the top 15 newspaper_city entries

--Create a table that counts the different entries in the "newspaper_city" column

--Create a table that counts all newspaper_city entries by year

--Create a simple column ggplot chart that shows the total entries by year

Armed with your data analysis, write a 250 word memo at the end of the R markdown document that summarizes your findings. Use this opportunity to ask questions or note any major flaws in the data.


```{r}
# loading the dataset
rio::import("https://github.com/wellsdata/CompText_Jour/blob/main/data/blackindex_master.csv")
