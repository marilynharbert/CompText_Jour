Abstract: Like the hanging stars in the Carousel film, letters addressed to Mac's dad float above Courtney O'Neill's clever paper-filled set. When the letters rain down on Mac, it's one of the show's funniest moments.

It wouldn't be fair to expect About Face Theatre's new artistic director Bonnie Metzger and managing director Rick Dildine to produce a world premiere for their first show. So even if Taylor Mac's The Young Ladies of... arrives largely prepackaged from New York, the revision for its amusing Chicago premiere does let us see one of the country's rising stars of drag performance art.
Taylor Mac's brand of writing and starring in drag-performance art is largely political and caked with loads of glam makeup. (He also plays the ukulele.) With The Young Ladies of..., Mac takes a more personal (though still political) turn by addressing subversive questions of masculinity, many of them directed at his late Texan father.
Mac seizes on the fact that his father corresponded with dozens of Australian women while he served in the Vietnam War. (Mac happened upon dozens of letters women sent after his father placed a newspaper ad seeking companionship in Sydney for his R&R stay.)
Mac also weaves Rodgers and Hammerstein's Carousel into the show, claiming it was his father's favorite movie musical. Mac is appalled at the musical seemingly condoning domestic abuse, yet he longs for its plot device of allowing a dead man to come back to Earth for one day to right the wrongs he caused.
Like the hanging stars in the Carousel film, letters addressed to Mac's dad float above Courtney O'Neill's clever paper-filled set. When the letters rain down on Mac, it's one of the show's funniest moments.
Admitting that his costume is less of his typical radical drag than an idea of one dreamed up by the patriarchy of his father's relatives, Mac goes about exploring society's condoned misogyny as he explicitly questions some of his father's more perplexing actions-the constant belittlement of anything feminine and the emotional lurch he created by giving hope to so many Australian women.
Metzgar does a good job of keeping interest through Mac's constant digressions and annotations throughout the show. Mac would have been even more effective if his energy didn't seem to lag in his many breathy and angrily exasperated sighs.
Mac could also have brushed up his dramaturgy, since there is no mention of the play that inspired Carousel (Ferenc Molnar's Liliom), which has a far less forgiving outcome for its anti-hero abuser than Rodgers and Hammerstein's version known as Billy Bigelow.
But aside from these qualms, The Young Ladies of... is a thoughtful and enjoyable show that should resonate with any gay man who has butch fathers known for their military service, riding motorcycles, or membership in the National Rifle Association (hey, that's me, too).
