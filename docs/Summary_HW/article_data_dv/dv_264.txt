Abstract: Somehow, the rights of the undocumented have become conflated with the "marriage rights/gay couples matter more than others" movement. Queer organizers insisted that their situationas queers whose relationships aren't recognized by the state (because, apparently, only marriage can legitimize a relationship)-was equal to that of the undocumented. Never mind the fact that none of them faced the harrowing issues of the undocumented.

Full text: The recent California decision on gay marriage fills me with dread-dread at the schlock I know is awaiting me during this Pride month and afterwards; dread about hearing all the triumphant rhetoric about "equality;" and dread that queers are going to speak about marriage as some kind of dream fulfilled. Again.
Because, of course, marriage will solve all our problems. No health care? Get married! Laid off? Get married! Struggling to pay bills and survive another month? Get married! Don't believe in marriage or that marriage should be the only way to gain health care and other benefits? Suck it up and start believing!
We queers have a unique ability to forget about the after-as in: What happens after "marriage equality"? Will our workplaces be better? Will we be less vulnerable to layoffs? Will our unmarried friends and neighbors have health insurance? Will the Lives of our married but uninsured friends and neighbors be any better with the legalization of gay marriage?
These questions preoccupied me as I watched the "gay movement" take up a cause in a cynical bid to further the idea that gay marriage/gay coupledom matters above all: Immigration. In this year's Chicago May Day march, gay groups joined together to form an official queer contingent.
Watching and talking to several of the key organizers of the contingent, I was struck by the great differences between queers who claimed to fight for immigration and queers who are themselves queer immigrants. For queer immigrants, immigration had to do with the rights of the undocumented. Many of them have friends and families who couldn't attend the march without consequences in their workplaces, and who faced deportation after recent raids. This year's march focused on the legalization of the undocumented and workers' rights.
Whether it's gay marriage or queer immigration, we have to understand that queers are more than the sum of all their relationships. We have no right to take on the cause of immigration without understanding the issues faced by immigrants themselves. And we can't delude ourselves into believing that love will conquer the problems with labor.
To be fair, many non-immigrants, especially younger queers, understood the key issues. But others were fixated on an issue that has nothing to do with the undocumented and even less with workers' rights: binational couples. According to them, gay couples should be able to sponsor their partners for immigration like married heterosexuals. In fact, this does nothing for the undocumented-citizenship via marriage is only available to the documented.
Somehow, the rights of the undocumented have become conflated with the "marriage rights/gay couples matter more than others" movement. Queer organizers insisted that their situationas queers whose relationships aren't recognized by the state (because, apparently, only marriage can legitimize a relationship)-was equal to that of the undocumented. Never mind the fact that none of them faced the harrowing issues of the undocumented.
