Full text: Hyde Park Art Center, 5020 S. Cornell Ave., is welcoming Nikki Patin as its new flex space resident through Feb. 28, 2020; she will be developing ongoing performative work combining text, music and movement.
Patin is a writer, performer and educator whose practice addresses issues of body image, sexual assault and the needs of the LGBTQ community. Also, she is the creator of Surviving the Mic-an organization dedicated to creating safe spaces for the creation and telling of stories of survivors of all kinds of trauma, with a special focus on Black- and female-identified survivors of sexual and domestic violence.
Patin was featured on the fourth season of HBO's Def Poetry Jam; has been one of Windy City Times 30 under 30 honrees; and took the gold medal in the poetry-slam competition at the 2006 Gay Games.
