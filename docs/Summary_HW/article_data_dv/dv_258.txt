Full text: During the week of the Large immigration march downtown, members of the community gathered at the Center on Halsted, 3656 N. Halsted, to discuss the many ways LGBT and immigration issues intersect.
At the April 30 Immigration at the Margins conference, members of various aspects of the LGBT community touched on just a small number of ways immigration issues impact the LGBT community, from corner day workers and sex workers to domestic violence.
"A lot of us are part of many worlds-queer, immigrants and more," said community activist and Windy City Times writer Yasmin Nair. "A lot of us have to deal with immigration."
During a two-hour discussion, conference participants tried to shed light on issues complicated by immigration issues.
Jessica Acee, a coordinator of the Latino Union's Albany Park Workers' Center, spoke about the issues Chicago immigrant day Laborers face each day, such as health and safety abuses; wage theft; and police abuse. Given a "20-year onslaught of the far right," Acee said, it's important to also talk about issues like racism, sexism and heterosexism in order to better and fully understand the framework.
Sex work and immigration were also discussed during the afternoon plenary session. Young Women's Empowerment Project co-director Shira Hassan discussed the issues Chicago girls and women in the sex trade face each day.
"It's always intersecting," Hassan said of both sex trade and immigration issues. "But it's only in the past year people have been frothing at the mouth about the sex trade and immigration," she added.
