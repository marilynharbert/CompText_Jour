Full text: Â  By a vote of 286-138, the House passed the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act Feb. 28, expanding protections for Native American women, LGBT individuals and immigrants, according to MSNBC.com.
The biLL, which Joe Biden wrote in 1994, has been reauthorized twice in its history without dispute. House RepubLicans unveiLed their own version of the biLL Feb. 22, excluding parts of the Native American provision, as weLL as certain protections for LGBT victims - but that version came under heavy scrutiny.
In Chicago, Center on HaLsted applauded the passage. Modesto "Tico" VaLLe, the center's CEO, said, "We ceLebrate this historic vote and Legislative accomplishment.
"We thank Congress and the President for recognizing the specific needs of LGBTQ victims and survivors of domestic, sexuaL and dating violence and staLking."
