Abstract: "The way our system is set up the insurance companies are legally allowed to discriminate against people with certain types of illnesses, such as HIV," stated one AFC leader. "HIV/AIDS groups have a significant role in the fight for healthcare reform. We really have an opportunity here to determine how those living with AIDS get access to healthcare as well as the opportunity to secure preventative care for all American citizens."

Full text: In response to the U.S. Senate Finance Committee's current debate over a national healthcare reform bill, the AIDS Foundation of Chicago (AFC), the Illinois Public Health Association and the Health Care for America Now held an informational teleconference Oct. 2 to explain the need for immediate healthcare reform.
According to speakers from AFC, approximately 47 million Americans are currently living without an effective healthcare option and that within the AIDS community nearly half of all those living with HIV/AIDS do not have adequate coverage in order to remain healthy.
"The way our system is set up the insurance companies are legally allowed to discriminate against people with certain types of illnesses, such as HIV," stated one AFC leader. "HIV/AIDS groups have a significant role in the fight for healthcare reform. We really have an opportunity here to determine how those living with AIDS get access to healthcare as well as the opportunity to secure preventative care for all American citizens."
According to experts who spoke at the teleconference, comprehensive healthcare reform, meaning a total reworking of the American healthcare system to include a public insurance option, would "increase access to consistent, high-quality, affordable, and comprehensive care for HIV and other health concerns" and increase the overall life expectancy of those living with HIV/AIDS "vastly."
'This is a critical time for healthcare reform in the United States," stated the Illinois director of Health Care for America Now, John Gaudette. "We are hearing now things like spousal abuse is a preexisting condition for some women or that women of childbearing age have a preexisting condition for child birth; we are seeing an uncontrolled abuse of the system by insurance companies and they can do this because of the millions they spend on lobbyists. However, people should know that we are working hard to change this and that in the 100 year battle over healthcare reform this is the closest we have ever gotten to complete change."
