Full text: Â  Amid the national uproar over a North Carolina law that codified discrimination against transgender people, more than 250 sexualassault and domestic-violence organizations released a landmark statement calling for an end to legislation that harms transgender people and excludes them from restrooms and other facilities.
"Safety and privacy are important for all of us," said Terri Poore, policy director at the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence. "Passing laws like the one in North Carolina to harm transgender people, or denying them protection from discrimination, does nothing to help survivors of violence or reduce assault. In fact, they do the opposite by putting transgender people at even greater risk of violence than they already are."
