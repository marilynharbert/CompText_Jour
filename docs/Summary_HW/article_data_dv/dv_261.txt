Gay men have a Lot to talk about, according to author David Halperin.
Halperin, author of What Do Gay men Want?, will be a guest at Project CRYSP's upcoming community forum on gay men's health, "'Good' Sex? 'Bad' Sex? Just What Do Gay men Want Anyway?" The forum, which will also feature panel experts such as DePaul University's Dr. Gary Harper and Northwestern University's Dr. Michèle Morales, will take place Thurs., April 17, 6 p.m., at the Center on Halsted, 3656 N. Halsted.
The debate will revolve around gay men's relation to sex and risk, and will touch on issues such as barebacking, the clichés that are still used to attempt to understand gay men and much more.
Windy City Times: Are there a lot of conversations that we aren't having when it comes to gay men's health?
David Halperin: I think there aren't enough of them. Part of it is the need to approach gay men's health in a holistic way that isn't centered just on disease or on various kinds of social problems such as alcohol abuse or domestic violence or HIV prevention-so, the need to look at gay men's health and gay men's sexual health, in particular, in a larger contest.
WCT: So, have we been taking the wrong approach?
DH: No, I think it's natural that we should be concerned about these things. But, the other conversation that we need to have that we haven't been having enough of is are we really going to stop using condoms? If we are going to stop using condoms, or if we're going to use them less, and if we are trying to protect ourselves from infection of HIV by other means-by means that don't involve using condoms-what exactly are those means? How can we make sure we pursue them intelligently so that we don't fail at preventing the spread of HIV?
WCT: Why is the community stopping condom use, after years of pounding it in our heads that this is what you need to do?
DH: A Lot of studies indicate that condom use is falling off. Some places, including the San Francisco Department of Public Health, have been promoting alternatives to the use of condoms for HIV prevention.
WCT: What are some of those alternatives?
DH: Things like partner selection, which is often called serosorting. The notion that one could perhaps avoid these condoms if one is having sex with someone who has the same HIV serology status as oneself. It's a technique that works better for HIV-positive men than HIV-negative men, since they are the ones who actually know what their HIV status is. Someone who tells you he is HIV-positive is probably not lying to you. But if we were to put more emphasis on sero sorting and partner selection, and less emphasis on condoms, certainly we need to talk about that and we need to try to make sure HIV risk reduction practices don't inadvertently produce risk increases.
WCT: The fact that someone like me thinks it's fairly new-is that because there has been so much emphasis on condom use?
DH: I think that's right. The CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] has not been promoting sero-sorting. The CDC has been promoting condom use and most HIV/AIDS prevention organizations promote condoms. But there has been relatively little attempt to try to figure out what gay men are actually doing on the ground and to try to adapt health initiatives to what people are actually doing, rather than do it to get gay men to adapt to health initiatives. Another reason you might not know about this is a lot of this has been taking place in HIVpositive communities.
WCT: Is another one of the issues that health officials have not tried to figure out what gay men really want?
DH: Right. There is a huge amount of energy being devoted to figuring out what gay men really want, but it's usually in the key of disease or impaired psychology. So the notion is, "Oh, we really have to figure out what gay men want because we have to explain why they are behaving so badly and so self-destructively-why they are doing these terrible things? What on earth is going on in their little minds? What explains this weird, self-destructive, harmful behavior? Why would a normal person ever act that way?
WCT: So it's very negative.
DH: It's very negative. It posits that there is some irrational behavior going on, and it tries to imply a medical reason, which is usually some form of impairment to explain this "irrational" behavior. Those explanations can range from the supposedly gay-friendly one like post-traumatic stress disorder or grief mourning, and so forth, all the way to lack of self-control, various psychological deficits.
