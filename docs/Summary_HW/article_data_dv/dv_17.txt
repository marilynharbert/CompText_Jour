Full text: Longtime activist and former Lambda Legal Midwest Regional Director James Bennett was named by Gov. J.B. Pritzker as the state's new Department of Human Rights director.
A statement from Pritzker noted that, during his 12-year tenure at Lambda Legal, Bennett, who is gay, was a lead strategist in the organization's Illinois and Iowa marriage campaigns and successfully fought Indiana's RFRA and their discriminatory 'religious refusal' laws.
In 2013, Bennett chaired Illinois Unites for Marriage, the statewide coalition that led the successful effort to win marriage equality in Illinois. He was inducted into the City of Chicago's Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame (now Chicago LGBT Hall of Fame) in 2013. Bennett's final appointment is pending confirmation approval from the Illinois State Senate.
In the same announcement, Pritzker's camp also announced that longtime activist Sol Flores has been named deputy governor. Flores is the founding Executive Director of La Casa Norte, a non-profit organization established in 2002. Founded in 2002, La Casa Norte now has 80 employees and offers assistance to homeless families, single parents, victims of domestic violence and abandoned youth.
