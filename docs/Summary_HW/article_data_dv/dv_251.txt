Full text: Farrah Fawcett, the actress renowned for her blonde hair, '70s show Charlie's Angels and best-selling poster died June 25. She was 62.
Fawcett, who checked into a hospital in early April, had been battling anal cancer for three years. CNN.com reported that longtime boyfriend Ryan O'Neal and her friend Alana Stewart were with Fawcett at Saint John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif., when she died.
A documentary on Fawcetfs battle with cancer called "Farrah's Story" aired on NBC May 15. Among Fawcetfs movies were the TV film The Burning Bed (1984), Extremities (1986) and The Apostle (1997).

Local TV stations will pay tribute to Fawcett. Beginning Saturday, June 27, and all through next week, Me-TV and THIStv will feature tributes to her. Me-TV (WCIU DT 26.2, Comcast Digital Cable Channel 223, DirecTV Channel 23, DISH Network Channel 23) will run episodes of Charlie's Angels Monday-Friday, June 29-July 3, at 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. THIStv (WCIU DT 26.4, Comcast 246, RCN 38 and WOW 195) will show The Nazi Hunter: Beate Klarsfeld Story July 1 at 7 p.m.; and Small Sacrifices July 1 at 3 p.m.
