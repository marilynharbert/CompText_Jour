Abstract: "While we welcome the new HUD guidance, we will also continue to improve our staff and volunteers' awareness of gender inclusion, ensuring that all female-identified and nonbinary individuals find a welcoming, supportive community at [Deborah]'s Place. We also believe that shelters are only a temporary and short-term solution to the complex problem of homelessness. ALL people need access to safe, affordable housing and supportive services to help them remain housed."

Full text: Â  The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) released Long-awaited guidance to ensure equal access for transgender people in homeless shelters, according to a press release from the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE).
The guidance, issued to shelters and transitional housing programs across the country, call for access to shelter and programs to be based on a person's self-identified gender. This follows similar guidance issued by the Department of Justice in 2014 for domestic violence shelters and other programs funded by the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).
However, while NCTE lauded this development, the release also stated, "we recognize that equal access to the current homeless services system is not enough. We share the goal of ending homelessness-and on the way to that goal, we must improve the way we provide housing."
Audrey Thomas-CEO of Deborah's Place, a Chicago shelter for homeless women-applauded the development. In an email to Windy City Times, she stated, "We are committed to ending homelessness for all, and we know that women and transgender individuals are both especially vulnerable to the underlying causes of homelessness.
"While we welcome the new HUD guidance, we will also continue to improve our staff and volunteers' awareness of gender inclusion, ensuring that all female-identified and nonbinary individuals find a welcoming, supportive community at Deborah's Place. We also believe that shelters are only a temporary and short-term solution to the complex problem of homelessness. ALL people need access to safe, affordable housing and supportive services to help them remain housed."
Several other homeless shelters-including Interfaith House, The Night Ministry and the Pacific Garden Mission-had not responded as of the press deadline.
