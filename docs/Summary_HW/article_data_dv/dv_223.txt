Abstract: SS: The duties of the lieutenant governor are fairly open-ended. The state constitution requires the lieutenant governor to be available to replace the governor, and that's about it as far as constitutional duties go. There are some important statutory duties, like heading the Rural Council and the Illinois River Coordinating Council. But there are a lot of open-ended opportunities.

Full text: Headnote ELECTIONS'10: LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR
Sheila Simon is a candidate for Illinois' lieutenant governor. Simon is a lawyer, professor and working mother. After graduating from Georgetown University Law School in 1987, she worked for Land of Lincoln Legal Assistance, where she advocated for people facing domestic violence, discrimination and loss of housing. She also helped to start Southern Illinois University Law School's domestic-violence clinic. Simon comes from a legacy of public service. Her parents, Paul and Jeanne Simon, served in the Illinois House together. (Paul was also a former lieutenant governor, U.S. representative and U.S. senator.)
Windy City Times: Can you begin with a brief overview of your professional and public service experience that you believe has prepared you for the position of lieutenant governor?
Sheila Simon: I am taking a leave right now as a professor at the law school at Southern Illinois University. Before that I was a prosecutor for a while. I prosecuted all the traffic cases in Jackson County for two years and domestic battery cases for two years. I've been on the City Council in Carbondale. I was in private practice for a while. And, I am a wife and a mom - so, all important qualifications, in my opinion.
WCT: Many people are unfamiliar with the office of lieutenant governor. What do you think are the most important duties of lieutenant governor, and why are you seeking the office?
SS: The duties of the lieutenant governor are fairly open-ended. The state constitution requires the lieutenant governor to be available to replace the governor, and that's about it as far as constitutional duties go. There are some important statutory duties, like heading the Rural Council and the Illinois River Coordinating Council. But there are a lot of open-ended opportunities. I am looking forward to using the office of lieutenant governor to get citizens more information about what levels of government can provide them as far as services and get information from citizens of Illinois about where we need to go in the state.
WCT: What are some of the public policy issues that are most important to you, and how would you use the office to make progress on those issues?
SS: I think the most important issue to me and everyone else is the economy and the state of the state economy. The governor has been doing a good job in preserving Illinois and bringing jobs to Illinois, but I would like to do more of that. One of the key ways I think I can help in that area is in the field of education. I think having strong public education in Illinois is the key to making sure we can build and attract jobs in Illinois.
WCT: Tell us why you think you and Gov. Quinn would make a good team.
SS: I think we already are a good team. He had a hand in picking me, and part of it is because we work together really well. We have the same sense of priorities in terms of jobs, in terms of education, in terms of environmental issues. So I really think we will be better able to work as team more than most pairs of governor and lieutenant governor who have been elected much more separately.
WCT: On the flip side, if you had been serving with Gov. Quinn since he took office, is there anything you would have advised him to do differently?
SS: We discussed this before I was selected - that we won't agree on everything. I can't imagine two people who would agree on everything. But, on the big deal issues, I think we share a sense of priorities. What I would like to bring to the process is a different perspective on things, and a different emphasis on some issues. As a teacher, education is really important to me, and the governor has indicated he would like to make me his point person on education. That is an important role where I think I will bring something extra to the administration - not just the same thing, but maybe a stronger sense of advocacy.
WCT: What have you done or what would you like to do to ensure equality for LGBT people in Illinois?
SS: I can tell you just in my own personal life, I am a strong advocate for equality for everyone, and certainly "everyone" includes the LGBT community. I served on the LGBT task force at Southern Illinois University to review our policies there, and as a result of that, we made some changes on our campus. As a lawyer, I have represented pro bono several parents who have sought a second-parent adoption, which is more of a common thing up in the Chicago area, but is not so common here in southern Illinois. And I am proud to say that there are families in southern Illinois who are complete legal families partly as a result of my help as an advocate for the children.
WCT: Do you support the legalization of same-sex marriage in Illinois?
SS: I do support same-sex marriage. This is one of those areas where the governor and I have - we agree that civil unions are a good step forward. I would like to make same-sex marriage available, and I think we're moving in that direction. I think there is growing acceptance in society, and recognition that there are healthy, loving relationships that come in a lot of varieties. And we are better off if we recognize and support those relationships rather than try to exclude some from recognition.
WCT: Is there anything else you would like voters to know about you and your goals?
SS: The one thing I would like to add is the critical importance of this election, not just in the LGBT community, but for everyone. In a time where many people are turned off by the political process, it is really important to have all of our voices heard. Democracy works better when there are more voices participating. I would encourage all of the folks who are reading this interview to make sure they vote and get their friends out to vote because it's an important election. In this race, it is not one of those races where you wish you could tell the differences between the two candidates. There are stark differences between Gov. Quinn and State Sen. Bill Brady, and I think it's going to be an easy vote to cast.
