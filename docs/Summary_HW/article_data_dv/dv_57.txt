Full text: The Institute for Sexual and Gender Minority Health (ISGMH) at Northwestern University, in collaboration with the University of Cincinnati, launched a new research study in November 2016.
The new research study, FAB 400, focuses on the personal experiences of sexual minority teenagers in Chicago who are assigned female at birth (AFAB). Taking place over two years, FAB 400 will examine if and how individuals' lives change as they enter into and out of different relationships.
FAB 400's main goal is to examine the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) in the LGBTQ community. It has been noted that IPV is two to three times more prevalent among LGBTQ teens than their heterosexual counterparts.
FAB 400 is currently seeking new participants who identify as people of color, assigned female at birth and identify as LGBTQ. Interested persons should complete the survey at goo.gl/ i0eDND or contact the research team at fab400@ impactprogram.org.
