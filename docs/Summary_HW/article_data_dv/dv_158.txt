Abstract: When it comes to compiling a List of Chicago-area LGBT shows for the fall season, where do you begin or end? Do you only include shows with LGBT characters like in Terrence McNally's Corpus Christi? Or does the List extend to works by queer authors or theater artists that might not feature any overt LGBT characters, like in Tennessee WilLiams' Sweet Bird of Youth? And what about shows that aren't specifically queer, but have big gay followings Like the musical DreamgirLs?

Full text:   "Theaten's so gay!"
About Face Theatre has used this expression in the past as a badge of pride rather than a homophobic putdown. And the expression is also very true, since the theater community has historically been accepting of LGTB creative types.
But when it comes to compiling a List of Chicago-area LGBT shows for the fall season, where do you begin or end? Do you only include shows with LGBT characters like in Terrence McNally's Corpus Christi? Or does the List extend to works by queer authors or theater artists that might not feature any overt LGBT characters, like in Tennessee WilLiams' Sweet Bird of Youth? And what about shows that aren't specifically queer, but have big gay followings Like the musical DreamgirLs?
