Full text: Â  Mudderella, the five-mile-plus obstacle course challenge designed for women by women, will make its third return to Chicago on Saturday, June 4.
Mudderella events are non-competitive challenges designed to empower women to work together while overcoming obstacles and having fun. Each course includes 12-15 signature Mudderella obstacles designed to test balance, agility, strength and teamwork in a fun and social setting.
More than 5,000 participants took part in the 2015 Chicago event, and this year's event is expected to be one of the biggest yet. Mudderella is a partner of Futures Without Violence, and its mission to prevent and put an end to domestic violence by developing educational programs and resources on domestic-violence awareness.
