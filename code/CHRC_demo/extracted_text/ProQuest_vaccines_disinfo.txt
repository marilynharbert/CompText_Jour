Full text: Russian-born tech mogul Pavel Durov, founder and CEO of the popular platform Telegram, has been detained in France, French authorities confirmed Sunday. According to French media, his detention is related to alleged offenses regarding the social media app.
The Russian Embassy in Paris said early Sunday that it had requested consular access to Durov and demanded that French authorities "ensure the protection of his rights."
"As of today, the French side has so far avoided cooperation on this issue," the embassy said in a statement posted on Telegram, adding that officials are in touch with Durov's lawyer.
Paris authorities said a statement regarding Durov's detention will be issued Monday.
Durov was once viewed as a Russian Mark Zuckerberg. But he left the country in 2014 after he lost control of his social network because he refused to hand over Ukrainian opposition organizations' data to security agencies.
French TV channel TF1 broke the news Saturday night, reporting that the billionaire was detained as he was traveling back from Azerbaijan aboard a private jet, which landed at the Bourget airport outside the capital.
Russia then sent a diplomatic note demanding access to Durov, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Sunday on Russian state TV, adding that the French government views his French citizenship as his primary nationality.
Durov lives in Dubai and is a dual citizen of the United Arab Emirates and France, according to Telegram. It's not clear whether he renounced his Russian citizenship. The 39-year-old's fortune is estimated by Forbes at about $15.5 billion.
Moderation rules under investigation The French newspaper Le Monde reported that authorities detained Durov as part of a preliminary investigation that focused on the lack of content moderation on Telegram and the platform's role in allegedly enabling criminal activity. The probe is looking at Telegram's failure to cooperate with law enforcement on matters including child pornography, cyberscams and organized crime, the newspaper said.
Telegram said Sunday that the company abides by applicable laws in the European Union and maintains content moderation practices that are aligned with "industry standards."
"Telegram's CEO Pavel Durov has nothing to hide and travels frequently in Europe," the company said. "It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner are responsible for abuse of that platform."
The French Interior and Justice ministries did not respond to requests for comment.
The online app's unmoderated messaging services have provided a platform for groups posting content that might be banned on other major social media networks, from right-wing groups to organized crime figures and militant groups.
Telegram is also popular with criminal syndicates and terrorist groups because of its encrypted messaging, which makes it hard for law enforcement authorities to monitor any illegal activities.
Hamas, for example, has posted grisly first-person videos of the conflict in Gaza to help build a narrative that its militants are freedom fighters justified in their killing and abduction of Israeli civilians. Visceral footage from body-worn GoPro cameras flooded its Telegram channels during the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel. (The app also hosts groups that claim the attacks were a "false flag" operation staged by Israel.)
Russia attempted to ban Telegram in 2018 over Durov's refusal to share encryption keys and give access to users' messages to the country's security services under laws passed by the Russian government to curb internet freedoms. But Russia has also used Telegram's online messaging services to post regular battleground updates - at times graphic and misleading - since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have countered with their own version of the conflict.
Other governments have considered banning Telegram, also citing content-moderation concerns. The German government, for example, weighed that option during a 2022 debate over coronavirus vaccines, citing Telegram's role in spreading anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.
In previous interviews with The Washington Post, Western officials have said Telegram has also been a useful tool for Russian military intelligence agency GRU to recruit for sabotage campaigns across Europe, including attempted disruptions and surveillance of transport lines used by NATO to supply Ukraine. In addition, Telegram had become a primary platform for Russia to disseminate disinformation in Europe and Ukraine, a senior European security official told The Post.
For his part, Durov has countered those allegations by arguing that his app, which passed 900 million monthly active users in 2024, should remain neutral and abstain from geopolitics.
Homegrown encryption Durov has alienated many potential allies by attacking the security of other encrypted services and rejecting criticism of Telegram's homegrown encryption, John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, told The Post on Saturday. "At the same time, it is a really scary precedent to see a CEO arrested over content," he said.
Russian officials and state media pundits quickly jumped on Durov's detention to attack the West, slamming the "double standards" when it comes to matters of free speech.
"The French continue their fight for 'freedom of speech' and 'European values,'" Russian lawmaker Andrei Klishas wrote on Telegram.
Russia's ambassador to international organizations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, said that Durov's detention was an example of the "very alarming totalitarian trends in countries which used to call themselves democratic."
"Some naive persons still don't understand that if they play more or less visible role in international information space it is not safe for them to visit countries which move toward much more totalitarian societies," Ulyanov wrote on X.
Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, who welcomed Zuckerberg to Russia in 2012, said that Durov's detention should serve as a cautionary tale to all Russian entrepreneurs who flee Russia because of pressure from the Kremlin.
"[Durov] thought that his biggest problems were in Russia, so he left and got citizenship and residence permits in other countries," Medvedev, who has emerged as one of the strongest anti-Western voices in Russia, wrote in a Telegram post. "He wanted to be a brilliant 'man of the world' living well without a homeland."
The outrage of the Russian political elite was echoed by some voices on the American right.
X owner Elon Musk called Durov's detention an "ad for the First Amendment," adding: "POV: It's 2030 in Europe and you're being executed for liking a meme."
"Pavel Durov left Russia when the government tried to control his social media company, Telegram," right-wing media personality Tucker Carlson, who recently interviewed Durov for his X-based show, wrote Saturday on X. "But in the end, it wasn't Putin who arrested him for allowing the public to exercise free speech. It was a western country, a Biden administration ally and enthusiastic NATO member, that locked him away."
Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene (R-Ga.) retweeted Carlson's post, adding that "free speech is under attack all over the world," while Chris Pavlovski, founder of the far-right site Rumble, wrote on X that French authorities had "crossed a red line by arresting [Durov], reportedly for not censoring speech."
Durov told Carlson in the interview that he fled Russia and resigned from his successful social media tech company, VKontakte, - which served as the Russian answer to Facebook - because of the Kremlin pressure to share personal data of Ukrainian pro-democracy protesters during the 2014 Maidan revolution. But he also said he felt pressured by the U.S. government to give its law enforcement a back door into Telegram.
"We get too much attention … whenever we came to the U.S.," Durov told Carlson.

Full text: 25% of adults say FBI instigated riot
Post-UMD poll finds 34% of Republicans hold view Twenty-five percent of Americans say it is "probably" or "definitely" true that the FBI instigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, a false concept promoted by right-wing media and repeatedly denied by federal law enforcement, according to a new Washington Post-University of Maryland poll.
The Post-UMD poll finds a smaller 11 percent of the public overall thinks there is "solid evidence" that FBI operatives organized and encouraged the attack, while 13 percent say this is their "suspicion only."
Among Republicans, 34 percent say the FBI organized and encouraged the insurrection, compared with 30 percent of independents and 13 percent of Democrats.
The results confirm that misinformation about Jan. 6 is widespread as the United States begins a presidential election year, during a campaign in which the former president and leading Republican candidate Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed support for those who participated in the insurrection. Despite a detailed congressional investigation and more than 725 completed federal prosecutions of Jan. 6 participants that did not yield evidence of FBI involvement, a substantial minority of Americans still embraces conspiracy theories not unlike the ones that drove many rioters to storm the Capitol three years ago.
"The people that went there to express their views, to support Trump, were peaceful," said Richard Baum, 61, an independent voter from Odessa, Tex. "The government implants were the violent ones: the FBI, the police people that were put in there, the antifa and BLM hired by George Soros; everybody knows that."
The Post-UMD poll finds 39 percent of Americans who say Fox News is their primary news source believe the FBI organized and encouraged the Jan. 6 attack, compared with 16 percent of CNN or MSNBC viewers and 13 percent who get most of their news from ABC, CBS or NBC. The poll finds 44 percent of those who voted for Trump say the FBI instigated the attack.
About 700 Jan. 6 defendants have pleaded guilty to federal crimes ranging from trespassing to violent assaults on police, and another 130 have been convicted at trial, after Trump directed angry supporters to march to the Capitol to oppose Congress's confirmation of the 2020 election results. In numerous hearings and trials, attorneys for defendants - including "QAnon Shaman" Jacob Chansley and ex-Proud Boy leader Henry "Enrique" Tarrio - have blamed Trump for the attack or their behavior in subsequent rioting that day, citing Trump's encouragement to "fight like hell" and his false claims of massive voter fraud.
The FBI has categorically rejected allegations of any involvement in sparking the Capitol riot. "This notion that somehow the violence at the Capitol on January 6 was part of some operation orchestrated by FBI sources and agents is ludicrous," FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said during a House hearing in July.
But the vast legal and evidentiary record to date has not appeared to sway people such as Travis Garcia, 34, a Republican from Rock Falls, Ill., who said, "I've read and seen a lot about these people being affiliated with the FBI." He cited a man who fits the description of Ray Epps, saying he was "trying to egg on violence before anything even happened." Epps, who became a focus of a conspiracy theory that the federal government ignited the Capitol riot, has pleaded guilty to trespassing and filed suit against Fox News for falsely depicting him as an FBI operative.
The poll results sparked dismay, but not surprise, among experts in disinformation and American media consumption.
"The finding that 25 percent believe the FBI was responsible for the Jan. 6 attack, sadly, fits in with the general nonsense and lies that are swirling around social and mainstream media," said Hany Farid, a professor at the School of Information at the University of California at Berkeley.
For example, a 2023 KFF poll last year found 34 percent believed the false claim that coronavirus vaccines have caused sudden deaths for thousands of healthy people, and a 2021 PRRI poll found 15 percent agreeing with a QAnon conspiracy theory that Satan-worshiping pedophiles control government, media and financial worlds.
"Whereas 20 years ago we may have argued about how or if to respond to events" such as the Capitol riot, Farid said, "today we are arguing about basic facts that are objectively and easily verifiable. ... We should all be greatly concerned for our democracy and societal stability."
Alex R. Piquero, a professor of sociology and criminology at the University of Miami and former head of the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, said people self-select their news and, in doing so, self-select the facts that reinforce what they believe.
Piquero said in an interview that the legitimacy of the 2020 election, skepticism of which motivated the attack on the Capitol, had been upheld in more than 60 court cases and confirmed by countless authorities on both sides of the political aisle.
"Sometimes, for some people, no amount of data is going to change their mind," Piquero said. "If you were to ask some people, do you trust the airplane you fly in? When you go get medicine from your doctor? It comes from science and data. People are willing to be okay on some of those things that are helpful to them, but when it contradicts their worldview, that's when it gets fuzzy and unfortunate."
Debunked rhetoric about the Jan. 6 attack has not been limited to the FBI conspiracy theory. Some have alleged that anti-Trump antifa instigated the riot or that police were complicit in the breach, fueling calls for the release of Capitol surveillance footage from that day that in turn re-energized claims of FBI involvement.
Partisan divisions over Jan. 6 are clear in the poll. Almost 8 in 10 Democrats (77 percent) say that those who entered the Capitol were "mostly violent," compared with 18 percent of Republicans, down slightly from 26 percent in 2021. About 140 police officers were assaulted on Jan. 6 at the Capitol, federal authorities have said, and more than 90 people have already been sentenced for felony assaults on law enforcement caught on video, with many similar cases still pending, according to a Post database.
Partisans are also split over the punishments for those charged in the Capitol riot. The Post-UMD poll finds 42 percent of Republicans say the punishments have been "too harsh," up from 32 percent two years ago, while 60 percent of Democrats say the punishments were "not harsh enough."
Post data shows the average sentence for a Jan. 6-related felony conviction is about 41 months, with judges imposing jail or prison in 94 percent of felony cases. For defendants charged only with misdemeanors, who make up about two-thirds of the Jan. 6 cases, about half have received jail terms averaging 58 days while the other half have received probation or home detention, the Post database shows.
Overall, 50 percent of Americans say the rioters were "mostly violent," down slightly from 54 percent in a 2021 poll. "It was very, very violent," said Kathleen Lenk, 62, a Democrat from Minneapolis. "I watched the video with my own eyes, of people beating policemen, injuring people." Lenk felt the FBI was not involved in the riot but should have taken more steps to stop it based on advance warnings received by law enforcement.
Edmund Pirali, 57, a Democrat from Sykesville, Md., was discouraged by the finding that a quarter of Americans think the FBI was involved in Jan. 6. "I am so disheartened," Pirali said, "about the dissociation in America from reality and fact. And it's so pervasive." He likened the belief in FBI involvement to believing in alien body snatchers and a flat Earth.
Some of those who believe in the FBI's involvement are very firm in their opinions. "I think it was all for Joe Biden," said January Vasquez, 48, of Berlin, Conn. "Because it's a conspiracy. Everything happens for a reason." She acknowledged some Trump supporters may have "crossed the line" at the Capitol, "but sometimes in life you gotta shake it up. Everybody's got a price tag. Somebody got paid to set that ... up." Vasquez said her news sources were local television stations, CBS and CNN.
Baum, of Odessa, said with the release of surveillance videos inside the Capitol on Jan. 6 to conservative news outlets, "you can clearly see there was nobody killed. Everybody that walked through the halls, peaceful. You even had Capitol Police escorting them through it. The people that said it was an insurrection, that was a joke."
QAnon follower Ashli Babbitt was killed by police, and three other rioters died in the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6. Multiple police officers died by suicide in the subsequent months. Surveillance video shown by media personalities such as Tucker Carlson omitted footage of violent clashes between police and Trump supporters both inside and outside the Capitol.
Asked why so many people have pleaded guilty to rioting charges if the FBI is to blame, Baum said that "the system targets you."
"It's political piracy," he said, adding: "You still have people being detained but not being charged. You better look into it. A lot of people that are being detained, they're just being held." He said video showed those who fought with police were "FBI plants" and "agitators that were being paid by Soros or his group." Baum said his sources of information were One America News, podcaster Dan Bongino, and Glenn Beck and his website the Blaze.
The U.S. attorney's office in Washington recently released a list of 18 people still detained before trial on Jan. 6 charges and said no one has been held without charges.

Full text: Statement proliferates debunked claim that the shots contaminate DNA
Florida's top health official called for a halt to using mRNA coronavirus vaccines on Wednesday, contending that the shots could contaminate patients' DNA - a claim that has been roundly debunked by public health experts, federal officials and the vaccine companies.
Florida Surgeon General Joseph A. Ladapo's announcement, released as a state bulletin, comes after months of back-and-forth with federal regulators who have repeatedly rebuked his rhetoric around vaccines. Public health experts warn of the dangers of casting doubt on proven lifesaving measures as respiratory viruses surge this winter.
"We've seen this pattern from Dr. Ladapo that every few months he raises some new concern and it quickly gets debunked," said Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University's public health school who led the White House's national coronavirus response before stepping down last year. "This idea of DNA fragments - it's scientific nonsense. People who understand how these vaccines are made and administered understand that there is no risk here."
Ladapo issued the bulletin as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), his political patron, fights to stay alive in the Republican presidential primary, in which he trails former president Donald Trump by more than 40 percentage points in head-to-head polls. The Iowa caucuses, the first nominating contest, are slated to be held Jan. 15.
"Providers concerned about patient health risks associated with COVID-19 should prioritize patient access to non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and treatment," Ladapo wrote.
Florida's health department did not respond to questions about whether Ladapo's new stance would affect vaccine access for the state's patients and health providers, or whether his decision to repeat debunked claims could create doubts about other routine vaccinations. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows that Florida lags far behind most states when it comes to the percentage of its population that has received an updated booster dose. Meanwhile, covid hospitalizations have been on the rise nationally, with almost 30,000 Americans newly hospitalized the week of Dec. 23.
Scott Rivkees, a DeSantis appointee who preceded Ladapo as Florida surgeon general before stepping down in September 2021, called Wednesday's announcement "surprising and disappointing" and at odds with settled science about the safety of coronavirus vaccines. But current DeSantis officials praised the announcement.
"Grateful to live in a state where Big Pharma does not dictate health policy recommendations," Christina Pushaw, a DeSantis campaign official, posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, where she thanked Ladapo "for standing up for scientific integrity." The DeSantis campaign did not respond to questions about whether the governor coordinated with Ladapo on the announcement or whether he would adopt a similar position if elected president.
Ladapo's move was lauded by a network of anti-vaccine allies, who have repeatedly claimed that the shots are ineffective as they push their own treatments with little or no scientific evidence.
Polling has shown that Republicans remain disproportionately skeptical of the coronavirus vaccines, a position sometimes amplified by GOP politicians: 55 percent of Republican respondents vowed that they would "definitely not get" the vaccine compared with 12 percent of Democrats, according to November polling released by health policy researchers at KFF.
Studies also suggest that differences in vaccination attitudes - and GOP voters' lower uptake of the vaccine - have been linked to Republicans dying at higher rates than Democrats from the coronavirus after vaccines became widely available in April 2021.
Trump has wanted to tout Operation Warp Speed, his 2020 initiative to successfully accelerate the development of coronavirus vaccines. But he talks about the vaccine sparingly on the 2024 trail and has expressed surprise to advisers about how much his supporters seem to dislike the vaccine, two advisers told The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity to relay private discussion. Trump's campaign did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Trump advisers note that DeSantis had used federal funds to promote the vaccines in Florida before taking a more skeptical tone.
Ladapo's claims about coronavirus vaccines are grounded in politics, not science, said David Gorski, a Wayne State University professor of surgery and oncology and managing editor of Science-Based Medicine, which debunks misinformation in medicine.
"I've never seen a state health authority parrot anti-vaccine disinformation as a justification for stopping the use of a vaccine that has saved so many lives before," Gorski said. "The Republican Party has adopted anti-vaccine, anti-public health ideology of this sort as part of its belief system."
Federal officials on Wednesday also reiterated their confidence in the mRNA vaccines, which were developed by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech and have been widely used since their global introduction in late 2020. More than 1.5 billion people around the world have received the vaccines, company spokespeople told The Post.
"It's one of the most studied vaccines at this point," CDC Director Mandy Cohen said, emphasizing that she and her family are vaccinated.
The Food and Drug Administration, which has authorized or approved several iterations of the coronavirus vaccines, on Wednesday stressed the shots' "safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality."
"Perpetuating references to information about residual DNA in COVID-19 vaccines without placing it within the context of the manufacturing process and the known benefits of the vaccine is misleading," FDA spokeswoman Cherie Duvall-Jones said in a statement.
Ladapo, a Harvard-trained physician and researcher who had not specialized in infectious disease, gained national attention writing columns in the Wall Street Journal that raised questions about public health interventions throughout the pandemic. The columns attracted the attention of DeSantis, who picked Ladapo in 2021 to oversee a roughly 15,000-person health department in the nation's third-most populous state.
In that role, Ladapo increasingly amped up warnings about the safety of the vaccines, often joined by colleagues and media personalities. His stances have drawn him into conflict with the FDA and federal officials who say his claims are baseless - and dangerous.

Rivkees, the former Florida surgeon general, cited state data showing more than 8,000 covid deaths in Florida last year.
"If you're going to take mRNA vaccination off the table ... and if you're not giving guidance to residents of Florida as to what to do to protect against covid, this is something that is a major deviation from public health," Rivkees said.

He appeared on the podcast of Del Bigtree, who led the anti-vaccine group Informed Consent Action Network before announcing this week that he joined Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign as the independent candidate's communications director. Ladapo also has appeared in an online program hosted by Stew Peters, a far-right media personality who has called for former presidential medical adviser Anthony S. Fauci to be hanged.
Ladapo's stances have drawn him into conflict with the FDA and federal officials who say his claims are baseless — and dangerous.
"We stand firmly behind our regulatory decision-making with the authorizations and approvals of the COVID-19 vaccines," Peter Marks, the FDA's top vaccine official, wrote to Ladapo on Dec. 14. "The challenge we continue to face is the ongoing proliferation of misinformation and disinformation about these vaccines which results in vaccine hesitancy that lowers vaccine uptake."
Rivkees, the former Florida surgeon general, cited state data showing more than 8,000 covid deaths in Florida last year — and "the vast majority are likely to be vaccine-preventable if people are up to date on their current vaccines."
"If you're going to take mRNA vaccination off the table … and if you're not giving guidance to residents of Florida as to what to do to protect against covid, this is something that is a major deviation from public health," Rivkees said.

Full text: The Democratic presidential challenger continues to espouse extreme ideas, but has dialed that messaging back in large public forums.
In an online meeting with anti-vaccine activists on June 27, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a Democrat running for president, falsely said there was good evidence that vaccine research had caused millions of deaths during the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic. He also claimed that such research could have created Covid-19, H.I.V. and other deadly viruses.
But in an appearance before Congress on July 20, Mr. Kennedy made none of those assertions. When lawmakers asked him about vaccines, he said: “I have never been anti-vax. I have never told the public to avoid vaccination.”
Even as Mr. Kennedy is a long shot for the Democratic nomination, he remains a case study of how a political figure can spread falsehoods and conspiracy theories at a large scale. And since he declared his presidential run in April, a gulf has appeared between what he says at political and campaign events and what he says on podcasts, at events and on shows that cater to anti-vaccine activists and conspiracy theorists, according to a review of his comments by The New York Times.
In large public forums like Congress, Mr. Kennedy, 69, has moderated his extreme views, while continuing to advocate them in other settings. At campaign stops in Iowa, Vermont and Virginia this summer, he spoke about the environment, foreign policy and the war in Ukraine, according to The Times’s review. He did not mention vaccines and limited his comments on Covid to criticism of pandemic lockdowns.
Yet during that same period, Mr. Kennedy appeared on more than two dozen podcasts hosted by personalities popular with the right wing, such as Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan, as well as in online meetings and video streams where he brought up a variety of fringe ideas. At times, he made unfounded claims about vaccines and questioned whether chemicals in the water supply were causing “sexual dysphoria” among children in the United States.
The shift in Mr. Kennedy’s behavior is stark after his nearly two decades of promoting unsubstantiated theories about vaccines and other matters. Misinformation researchers said the candidate had probably tempered his most extreme positions to appeal to a wider audience and win over voters.
“If you only hear what he says in those big, open forums, you might think this is a reasonable, moderate person I want to support — and that is the point,” said Kolina Koltai, a misinformation researcher who has studied anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. “He is making himself mainstream.”
When Mr. Kennedy raises topics that he has extreme views on, he now does so more subtly, Ms. Koltai said. In campaign forums, he often poses his ideas about vaccines as questions, such as asking if coronavirus vaccines were produced too quickly or questioning the safety protocols around other vaccines, she said.
Mr. Kennedy’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment, but previously said in a statement to CNN that the candidate was being “mischaracterized.”
Recent opinion polls suggest that Mr. Kennedy, a scion of the Kennedy family and an environmental lawyer and activist, has the support of around 12 percent of Democratic voters. He has attracted some high-profile backers, including Elon Musk, the Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, the National Football League star Aaron Rodgers and the actress Alicia Silverstone.
Mr. Kennedy’s public work against vaccines began in 2005, when he published articles in Rolling Stone and Salon claiming a link between vaccines and autism. The news outlets later withdrew the articles. In 2018, he founded Children’s Health Defense, a nonprofit in Washington that has promoted anti-vaccine ideology.
During the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Kennedy spoke at dozens of events where he claimed that the drugs ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine could help treat Covid. Numerous studies published during and after the pandemic have found otherwise. Mr. Kennedy has not addressed those studies.
Mr. Kennedy also produced a 2021 movie that suggested Black Americans should not get vaccinated, even as health officials said such claims were dangerous. And he wrote a book claiming that Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s top medical adviser for the pandemic, and Bill Gates, a founder of Microsoft, conspired with drug companies to profit from vaccines. Dr. Fauci and Mr. Gates have rebutted the claims.
In 2021, the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit that conducts research on social media, named Mr. Kennedy as one of the “Disinformation Dozen,” which it called the top 12 superspreaders of misinformation about Covid on the internet.
Mr. Kennedy has also used his platform to promote other misleading ideas, including that 5G networks are being used for mass surveillance.
“You have a bleeding-over from vaccines to broad conspiratorial ideas on a number of topics,” said Jonathan Jarry, a scientist and science communicator with McGill University’s Office for Science and Society. “He promotes a whole worldview that is not just about opposing vaccines — it is about distrust of government, media and other bodies, while promoting trust in him.”
When Mr. Kennedy said he was running for president, his behavior shifted immediately. In a nearly two-hour speech announcing his candidacy, he did not mention vaccines or promote conspiracy theories.
“My mission over the next 18 months of this campaign and throughout my presidency will be to end the corrupt merger of state and corporate power,” he said, going on to criticize government spending, corporate power and pandemic lockdowns.
In campaign appearances over the summer, Mr. Kennedy was circumspect. During a June 5 audio event with Mr. Musk on X, the service formerly known as Twitter, Mr. Kennedy made a passing reference to vaccines and limited his remarks to the difficulties that people faced during the lockdowns.
He similarly skirted mentioned of vaccines when he campaigned in June in Vermont and at last month’s Iowa State Fair, a popular stomping ground for presidential candidates. In an interview with Mr. Kennedy that was posted on Aug. 14, Tucker Carlson opened by noting that it would make no mention of vaccines.
At the same time, Mr. Kennedy espoused extreme views on podcasts. In June, he told Mr. Peterson, a psychologist and an author, that chemicals in the water supply could turn children transgender. That same month, Mr. Kennedy appeared on Mr. Rogan’s podcast and presented false or unfounded claims, including that aluminum in vaccines causes autism and that Wi-Fi causes chronic illness.
Late last month, Children’s Health Defense announced a “people’s bus tour” across the United States to collect stories from people who were harmed by vaccinations and other health protocols introduced during the pandemic. The side of the bus was emblazoned with “Vax-Unvax,” the title of Mr. Kennedy’s new book.
The book, released on Aug. 29, includes faulty claims about vaccines and relies on findings from at least one discredited study.

Full text: One day after a Louisiana federal judge set limits on the Biden administration's communications with tech firms, the State Department canceled its regular meeting Wednesday with Facebook officials to discuss 2024 election preparations and hacking threats, according to a person at the company. The move came hours before Biden's Department of Justice filed a notice that it will appeal the ruling.
State Department officials told Facebook that all future meetings, which had been held monthly, have been "canceled pending further guidance," said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve working relationships. "Waiting to see if CISA cancels tomorrow," the person added, referring to the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
The person at Facebook said they presumed similar meetings the State Department had scheduled with other tech companies also were canceled, but that could not be confirmed immediately. Representatives for the State Department did not respond to a request for comment. CISA declined to comment, referring questions to the Justice Department. A Justice Department official declined to comment on the cancellations, but said the agency expects to request a stay of the District Court's decision "expeditiously."
Representatives for Google, which owns YouTube, and other social media companies did not immediately respond.
The cancellation of regular meetings between Facebook parent company Meta — the world's largest social media firm — and U.S. government agencies shows the immediate impact of Tuesday's order by U.S. District Judge Terry A. Doughty, a Trump appointee. The order is a win for the political right in a broader battle over the role of social media companies in shaping online speech and information.
While the ruling won't stop sites such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube or TikTok from moderating online content, it stands to sideline federal government officials and agencies that had become key contributors to those efforts. In the past, meetings between the State Department and Facebook in particular have flagged suspected foreign influence operations for the companies to investigate.
The canceled meetings show that the injunction is affecting government efforts to protect elections, said another person who is familiar with the talks and spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid legal entanglement.
When tech companies and State Department officials meet, "they talk about foreign influence, they compare notes. It gives them the opportunity to ask questions about foreign influence they are seeing," this person said. "State will share Russian narratives, things they are seeing in state media in Russia about U.S. topics. They will ask whether Facebook is seeing things from known entities, such as the Chinese Communist Party or the Internet Research Agency," the Russian entity thought responsible for much of the interference in the 2016 election.
The person at Facebook confirmed that the meetings include two-way sharing of information on foreign influence operations.
A former Department of Homeland Security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they feared legal or political retaliation, said they believed meetings are being canceled because general counsels at the various agencies are parsing the implications of the 155-page ruling. Ultimately, many of the activities they pursued, such as warnings about election disinformation, are exempted from the injunction and are likely to continue, the person said.
"I would expect to see DOJ or the White House take the first public steps," the former official said. "There will likely be a chilling effect from overly cautious government counsels. What previously had been inbounds will look too close to the line, or we're not sure how it's going to work."
Issued on the Fourth of July, the order found that the Biden administration probably violated the First Amendment in applying pressure to Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and other social media firms to restrict the viral spread of posts that stoked fears about coronavirus vaccines or fueled false claims related to U.S. elections.
Leading U.S. social media companies began coordinating regularly with the federal government in 2017, following revelations of a Russian campaign to sow discord among Americans during the 2016 presidential election campaign. Partnerships between Silicon Valley and Washington on what the tech companies call "content moderation" deepened and broadened during the pandemic, when platforms such as Twitter, Google's YouTube, and Meta's Facebook and Instagram became hotbeds for conspiracy theories about the virus and opposition to public health guidance.
The attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana, along with a host of other plaintiffs, sued Biden and a bevy of government agencies and officials in 2022, alleging that they had cajoled and coerced the tech firms into removing or suppressing speech that is protected under the First Amendment. The Biden administration has argued that it did not violate the First Amendment, but rather used its bully pulpit to promote accurate information in the face of a public health crisis and foreign interference in U.S. elections.
On Tuesday, Doughty, who sought to block several Biden administration mandates during the pandemic, sided largely with the plaintiffs. He issued a preliminary injunction that prohibits several federal agencies and their employees from "meeting with social-media companies for the purpose of urging, encouraging, pressuring, or inducing in any manner the removal, deletion, suppression, or reduction of content containing protected free speech."
Doughty's decision left exceptions for the government to continue to communicate with tech companies, including carveouts for officials to warn Silicon Valley about criminal activity, foreign election interference and cyberattacks.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the meeting cancellations. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during a briefing with reporters on Wednesday that the administration disagrees with the injunction. The Department of Justice continues to review it and evaluate its options, she said.
Jean-Pierre said that the administration has been "consistent" in its dealings with tech firms and that it will "continue to promote responsible actions to protect public health, safety and security when confronted by challenges like a deadly pandemic and foreign attacks on our elections."
"Our view remains that social media platforms have a critical responsibility to take action or to take account of the effects their platforms are having [on] the American people, but make independent choices about the information they present," she said.
Meta, Twitter and Google have declined to comment on the injunction. But the judge's decision creates uncertainty about the future of content moderation at the companies ahead of the 2024 elections and raises legal questions about how they will communicate with officials at all levels of government about falsehoods related to voting.
The Biden administration is likely to appeal the injunction before voters head to the polls next year. But in the interim, the order is poised to have a chilling effect on the companies' efforts to guard against misinformation as they work to sort out what types of partnerships are allowed.
Tech companies are already taking significant steps to unwind programs to combat disinformation on their services. Under the helm of Elon Musk, Twitter has slashed its Trust and Safety teams and initiatives. Amid financial pressure and company layoffs, Meta has also made cuts to similar teams.
"There is so much wrong with this decision — not least of all that it will make us less secure going into the 2024 elections," wrote Yoel Roth, the former head of Trust and Safety at Twitter, in a social media post. Roth said the most glaring problem with the decision is that it asserts the companies were "coerced" to remove posts simply because they met with government officials. "That's just … not how any of this works," he wrote.
Roth's work at Twitter has come under the glare of Republican politicians. He has said during testimony before Congress that Twitter independently made decisions to remove content its staffers believed violated its rules. He said the U.S. government "took extraordinary efforts" to ensure it did not even hint at demanding the company remove posts.
Emails produced as evidence in the case also show tech companies pushing back against the Biden administration, at times telling government officials that the videos or posts they flagged did not run afoul of their policies against misinformation. The companies' decisions frequently appeared to prompt frustration among Biden White House officials.
In April 2021, then-White House adviser Andy Slavitt sent an email to Facebook staff with the subject line, "Tucker Carlson anti-vaccine message," noting that it was "number one on Facebook." Later that day, a Facebook staffer responded, saying the video did not qualify for removal under its policies. The employee said the company was demoting the video and labeling it with a "pointer" to accurate information about the vaccine.
The company's decision to leave the video up prompted backlash from Rob Flaherty, a another former White House official, who responded: "Not for nothing but last time we did this dance, it ended in an insurrection."
The lawsuit also named as defendants several academics and civil society organizations that had contributed to partnerships between the online platforms and the government. On Wednesday, researchers outside of government and companies were reeling from the injunction and sorting out how to handle it.
"There's no version of us being able to do our job, or other versions of the field of trust and safety, without being able to communicate with all stakeholders, including government and including industry," said a leading researcher on extremism and foreign influence who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing litigation.
Another researcher, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity because of pending litigation, added: "Platforms had already gutted their trust and safety departments, and now they aren't supposed to [talk to the] government." The person added, however, that "information sharing between platforms and government in this area was always fairly minimal."
Doughty's ruling is unlikely to be the last word on the question of what level of government pressure on platforms constitutes a First Amendment violation, said Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity law professor at the U.S. Naval Academy.
"The really tough question is when does the government cross the line from responding to speech — which it can and should do — to coercing platforms to censor constitutionally protected speech?" Kosseff said. "The judge here believes that line was crossed, and he certainly cited some persuasive examples," such as administration officials suggesting antitrust actions against tech firms or changes to their liability protections while criticizing their content moderation efforts.

Full text: LIMITS PRESSURE
TO REMOVE posts
States win round in suit alleging 'censorship' A federal judge on Tuesday blocked key Biden administration agencies and officials from meeting and communicating with social media companies about "protected speech," in an extraordinary preliminary injunction in an ongoing case that could have profound effects on the First Amendment.
The injunction came in response to a lawsuit brought by Republican attorneys general in Louisiana and Missouri, who allege that government officials went too far in their efforts to encourage social media companies to address posts that they worried could contribute to vaccine hesitancy during the pandemic or upend elections.
The Donald Trump-appointed judge's move could undo years of efforts to enhance coordination between the government and social media companies. For more than a decade, the federal government has attempted to work with social media companies to address criminal activity, including child sexual abuse images and terrorism.
Over the past five years, coordination and communication between government officials and the companies increased as the federal government responded to rising election interference and voter suppression efforts after revelations that Russian actors had sowed disinformation on U.S. social sites during the 2016 election. Public health officials also frequently communicated with the companies during the coronavirus pandemic, as falsehoods about the virus and vaccines spread on social networks including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.
"The injunction is strikingly broad and clearly intended to chill any kind of contact between government actors and social media platforms," said Evelyn Douek, an assistant professor at Stanford Law School.
The injunction was a victory for the state attorneys general, who have accused the Biden administration of enabling a "sprawling federal 'Censorship Enterprise'" to encourage tech giants to remove politically unfavorable viewpoints and speakers, and for conservatives who've accused the government of suppressing their speech. In their filings, the attorneys general alleged the actions amount to "the most egregious violations of the First Amendment in the history of the United States of America."
The judge, Terry A. Doughty, has yet to make a final ruling in the case, but in issuing the injunction, he signaled he is likely to side with the Republican attorneys general and find that the Biden administration ran afoul of the First Amendment. He wrote that the attorneys general "have produced evidence of a massive effort by Defendants, from the White House to federal agencies, to suppress speech based on its content."
The ruling could have critical implications for tech companies, which regularly communicate with government officials, especially during elections and emergencies such as the coronavirus pandemic.
In his order, the judge made some exceptions for communications between government officials and the companies, including to warn them of national security threats, criminal activity or voter suppression. Douek said that the list of exemptions underscored that there were difficult issues at stake in the case but that the order lacks clear guidance about "where the lines are."
A White House official said the Justice Department "is reviewing the court's injunction and will evaluate its options in this case."
"This Administration has promoted responsible actions to protect public health, safety, and security when confronted by challenges like a deadly pandemic and foreign attacks on our elections," the official said. "Our consistent view remains that social media platforms have a critical responsibility to take account of the effects their platforms are having on the American people, but make independent choices about the information they present."
Google, which is among the companies named in the suit, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Facebook parent company Meta declined to comment, and Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.
The judge's order puts limits on some executive agencies with a variety of responsibilities across the federal government, including the Department of Justice, the State Department, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It also names more than a dozen individual officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Jen Easterly, who leads the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
In addition to limiting the government's communications with tech companies, Doughty prohibited the agencies and officials from "collaborating, coordinating, partnering, switchboarding, and/or jointly working with" key academic groups that focus on social media, including the Election Integrity Partnership, a coalition of researchers led by the Stanford Internet Observatory and the University of Washington Center for an Informed Public. House Republicans have also been demanding documents from these academics, amid accusations that they have colluded with government officials to suppress conservative speech.
The lawsuit marks a critical inflection point in a years-long, partisan battle over speech on social media. For years, Republicans have argued that social media companies' policies to address disinformation related to elections and public health have resulted in the unfair censorship of their political views. Meanwhile, Democrats have argued that the companies have not gone far enough in policing their services to ensure they do not undermine democratic institutions.
The lawsuit brought by the Louisiana and Missouri attorneys general is at the forefront of a broader GOP effort to allege that the Biden White House is putting "unconstitutional" pressure on the tech companies to eliminate disfavored views online. Such accusations have been fanned in multiple lawsuits, as well as in congressional hearings and probes in the Republican-led House of Representatives.
But the lawsuit marks a new twist in Republicans' complaints that tech companies are silencing their views. Instead of targeting the tech companies, which say they have a First Amendment right to decide what appears on their sites, the lawsuit targets the federal government's role in that process in the most successful legal effort to date to counter tech company moderation efforts.
The Republican state attorneys general argue that the Biden administration ran afoul of the First Amendment by threatening legal action against the tech companies amid disputes over speech on the platforms. Their complaint cites occasions when the Biden administration threatened to take antitrust action against the companies or undo Section 230, a legal shield that protects tech giants from lawsuits.
"The deep state planted a seed of suppression of government censorship, but that seed was fertilized, germinated and grew rapidly once President Biden took office," Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey said in an interview with The Washington Post before the decision.
"Deep state" refers the unsubstantiated idea, frequently invoked by Trump, that a group of bureaucrats is working to undermine elected officials to shape government policy.
The Trump administration made similar arguments during battles with the social media companies - and at times went further. In 2020, Trump signed an executive order that directed the Federal Communications Commission to rethink the scope of Section 230. That order came in the same week that Twitter applied fact-checking labels to two of Trump's tweets.
The Biden administration disputes the Republicans' claims, arguing that the communications that the GOP officials uncovered reflect the government using its bully pulpit to promote accurate information in the face of foreign interference in elections and a deadly virus.
Justice Department lawyers argued during a May hearing that the Republicans' accusations were laced with "hyperbole," according to a court transcript. They also warned that an injunction could undermine national security efforts, since the Republicans' lawsuit critiques multiple programs that were established to respond to evidence that Russian actors exploited American social networks to sow disinformation in the fallout of the 2016 election.
The Republicans' case hinges on tens of thousands of communications, including emails and messages, between Biden administration officials and social media companies, largely occurring between 2020 and 2021. The state attorneys general have argued that starting in 2017 - four years before Biden was president - officials within the government began laying the groundwork for a "systemic and systematic campaign" to control speech on social media.
These efforts accelerated in 2020, while Trump was still president, amid the response to the coronavirus outbreak and efforts to secure the 2020 election, the attorneys general argued in court. They said those endeavors took a "quantum leap" forward once Biden became president, as the White House both publicly and privately pressured major tech companies to remove posts that could contribute to vaccine hesitancy, while at the same time threatening to regulate the social media companies.
Some individuals who think their posts were unfairly censored by social media companies joined the Republican state attorneys general in the lawsuit. They include Jim Hoft, owner and operator of the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website. Hoft alleges that his social media accounts were suspended in response to comments he made about coronavirus vaccines and mail-in ballots. Another plaintiff, Jill Hines, alleges she was "censored" because she opposed mask mandates for young children.
Doughty's order comes as social media companies recently have begun to unwind some of the programs created to address disinformation. Under Elon Musk's ownership, Twitter has made steep cuts to its Trust and Safety division and has increased its reliance on Community Notes, its program of crowdsourced fact checks on tweets. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has laid off staff working on content moderation amid financial pressure.
In his interview with The Post, Bailey praised these recent moves.
"There are deep concerns here that the government's unrepentant attitude demonstrates a willingness to continue to violate the First Amendment," he said. "That's why this wall of separation is so important, regardless of the steps that Big Tech is taking independent of our lawsuit."

Republicans Elder header
Start of nest
Larry Elder, a conservative talk radio host who unsuccessfully sought to unseat Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) in California's 2021 recall election, announced in April that he is running for the Republican nomination for president. During his bid for governor, Elder opposed the minimum wage, called to let employers ask female applicants whether they plan to get pregnant, rejected the coronavirus vaccine mandate for state workers and endorsed Trump's false assertion that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent.
On his website for his presidential bid, Elder focuses on standard Republican issues including fighting crime, securing the border and addressing inflation.

Democrats Potential Republican candidates Candidate header Cheney
Start of nest
Former Wyoming congresswoman Liz Cheney has waged a long, lonely battle to steer her party away from Trump, persistently criticizing the former president and warning of the damage she says he is doing not just to the GOP but also to democracy. For such efforts, Cheney was ousted in 2021 from her position as House conference chair and replaced with Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), a staunch Trump defender. Cheney would go on to serve as one of two Republicans on the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection.
Last year, Cheney lost her primary race in Wyoming to Harriet M. Hageman, an election denier, by a historic margin. Cheney has vowed to do whatever it takes to prevent Trump from reaching the White House again and has not ruled out running for president herself.
End of nest
Candidate header Noem
Start of nest
Kristi L. Noem, the Republican governor of South Dakota, won reelection to her second term in November and has gained attention within conservative circles for shrugging off restrictions and mandates in her state during the pandemic. She has claimed the state got through the pandemic "better than virtually every other state," though South Dakota in 2020 had among the highest coronavirus infections and death tolls per capita.
Her team has been watching potential rivals on the national stage, with one adviser contrasting her with DeSantis late last year and a spokesman openly criticizing the Florida governor's record on abortion. But it's not clear Noem will take the plunge for 2024. Asked about a potential run during a February visit to Washington, D.C., she didn't rule it out but also didn't say she's interested.
End of nest
Candidate header Youngkin
Start of nest
Glenn Youngkin quickly drew presidential buzz after winning the Virginia governor's race in 2021 and stumping for other Republicans in purple states during the 2022 midterms. He has repeatedly said he is "humbled" by speculation he could run for president and has not publicly ruled it out. But he has also said recently that he is focused on Virginia's upcoming elections. Jeff Roe, a top political adviser to Youngkin, recently joined a super PAC supporting DeSantis for 2024, raising further doubts about Youngkin's interest in a national campaign. But Youngkin recently fed 2024 presidential buzz with a video ad linking him to Ronald Reagan.

Donald Trump Republican candidate Former president Donald Trump announced his third White House bid in mid-November from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla. Prominent Republicans appeared newly willing to criticize Trump after the midterms, but Trump has solidified his status at the head of the pack in recent months.
Many Republicans have rallied to Trump's defense following a federal indictment related to mishandling classified documents and a New York indictment related to allegations about hush money paid to an adult-film star. In speeches, Trump has repeated his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and cast the New York charges as the latest effort to thwart him.
Doug Burgum Republican candidate North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum announced a long-shot presidential run. The wealthy tech entrepreneur turned governor was first elected to his job in 2016, when he won a three-way race with nearly 77 percent of the vote.
In his campaign launch in Fargo, Burgum outlined an agenda focused on his plans to help the nation adapt to a rapidly changing economy, expand domestic energy production and address the most pressing national security threats. "Woke was what you did at 5 a.m. to start the day" growing up in a tiny town in North Dakota, he said in a video teasing his kickoff.
Chris Christie Republican candidate Chris Christie, who was governor of New Jersey from 2010 to 2018, filed paperwork in early June to run for president in 2024. He also ran for president in 2016. Ramping up his travel with visits to New Hampshire and speaking to donors around the country, Christie has cast himself as uniquely equipped to attack Trump as other Republicans shy away from direct criticism.
Christie endorsed Trump quickly in 2016 after dropping out of the race and led Trump's transition team, but he later grew critical of Trump and has made some of the bluntest calls for his party to shift direction.
Ron DeSantis Republican candidate Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis filed paperwork for a presidential run in late May, moving ahead with a long-expected campaign that many Republicans viewed as the most formidable primary challenge to Trump. As a first-term governor, DeSantis derided pandemic-driven shutdowns and vaccine mandates and cast himself as an enemy of what he calls "woke ideology" in the news media, major companies such as Disney and schools, where he has worked to restrict discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity.
Fresh off a landslide reelection, DeSantis has raked in donations. But he's lost significant ground to Trump in recent polls.
Nikki Haley Republican candidate Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who later served as Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, was the first prominent Republican to challenge Trump for the presidency. If she wins the GOP nomination, Haley would be the first female and the first Asian American GOP presidential nominee. She has called for "a new generation of leadership" and highlighted her gender and her family's immigrant roots while rejecting "identity politics."
Haley has distanced herself from Trump at times, saying in 2021 that his post-election actions "will be judged harshly by history," but said later that year that she would not run if Trump did.
Asa Hutchinson Republican candidate Asa Hutchinson, who spent eight years as governor of Arkansas, kicked off his presidential bid in April. He urged Republicans to look past Trump well before the midterms intensified some GOP doubts about the former president: In January, Hutchinson said the ex-president's role in the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the Capitol "disqualifies" him from another term. Hutchinson, a former U.S. attorney who also served in President George W. Bush's administration, is one of many lesser-known 2024 hopefuls traveling extensively to early-nominating states and hoping to break through.
Mike Pence Republican candidate Mike Pence, who served as Trump's vice president, made his presidential bid official in June after traveling to key primary states and pitching himself as a "Christian, a conservative and a Republican - in that order." He has leaned into issues that other Republicans find politically uncomfortable, calling for changes to Medicare and Social Security and advocating abortion restrictions while highlighting the Trump administration's role in overturning Roe v. Wade .
Pence most famously broke with Trump when he refused to interfere with the certification of Biden's electoral win on Jan. 6, 2021. Pence said he and Trump may never "see eye-to-eye" over what happened on Jan. 6.
Vivek Ramaswamy Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, a wealthy entrepreneur and author of "Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam," became the third declared Republican contender for president in February. The long-shot candidate is centering his campaign on opposition to all things "woke," tapping into a common theme for conservatives who have criticized diversity programs and certain concepts of race and gender. Among Ramaswamy's proposals: ending affirmative action and raising the voting age to 25.
Tim Scott Republican candidate Tim Scott, the only Black U.S. senator in the GOP, joined the presidential race officially in May, and his team announced a $6 million advertising buy that it says will run through the first GOP debate. The South Carolinian has highlighted his family's "cotton to Congress" story while also declaring that "America is not defined by our original sin," pitching himself as an unusually compelling messenger against the political left while also striking a more hopeful, positive tone.
While Scott has yet to break through in national polling, he has significant financial resources for a campaign. He started with $22 million in cash from his Senate campaign account and millions more in a super PAC.
Joe Biden* Democratic candidate President Biden is seeking reelection, saying he wants to "finish the job" he started when the country was besieged by a deadly pandemic, a reeling economy and a teetering democracy. Polling shows that many Democrats would prefer a nominee other than Biden in 2024, and at 80 he is the oldest president in U.S. history to seek a second term. But major Democratic leaders have not taken steps to challenge him, and his party's better-than-expected performance in the 2022 midterms helped quiet critics.

* Incumbent
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Democratic candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a controversial member of the storied Kennedy family who is known for his anti-vaccine views, has filed to run for president. Kennedy, 69, parlayed his famous last name into years of advocacy as an environmental lawyer and best-selling author. In recent years, however, he has become better known as one of the country's most prominent opponents of vaccines and has peddled false claims linking them to autism. He gained even more notoriety during the pandemic while spreading disinformation about coronavirus vaccines.
Marianne Williamson Democratic candidate Activist and self-help author Marianne Williamson is waging a long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination. Williamson is positioning herself to Biden's left, advocating tuition-free higher education at public institutions, among other initiatives. She also ran for president in 2020, calling for "a moral and spiritual awakening" in the United States, and dropped out shortly before the first nominating contests.
"We need to offer fundamental economic reform. Nothing short of that will beat the Republicans in 2024," she told The Post in an interview.

Full text: Son of a famous senator shows early strength against Biden in polls
INDIANAPOLIS - Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a candidate for president supported by 1 in 5 Democratic voters in some recent polls, campaigns on the idea that powerful people have been working in secret to deceive you.
He began a recent speech here by recounting the Eisenhower administration's 1960 decision to lie when the Soviets downed an American spy plane by calling it weather research. Then came further deceptions - some proven, some refuted, many just conjecture.
Before long, Kennedy was arguing that a 2019 tabletop exercise about a mock pandemic, archived on YouTube, actually revealed a secret plan involving U.S. spymasters to enrich drug companies and suppress free speech. He then rattled off clinical data from a coronavirus vaccine trial that was not designed to measure mortality, falsely suggesting that vaccines killed more people than they saved.
He made no mention of the abundant science that has found that the vaccine prevented serious illness and saved lives.
" We were lied to by the government and by the media," he told a well-heeled crowd of hundreds of political skeptics at the Meridian Hills Country Club, many dressed in spring pastels or sockless shoes, some with wine glasses in hand. "And so it was all confusing, because they keep us confused. "
That alarmist message has given him a platform that he believes will remake the Democratic Party and fulfill the ambitions denied his father, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-N.Y.), and stolen from his uncle, President John F. Kennedy - two men he argues, based on circumstantial evidence, were probably assassinated by elements of the CIA, which the government has denied.
"I could not run except in this election, and really covid integrated and systemized a deception in ways that are beyond the experience of our country ," he said in an interview with The Washington Post hours before his country club speech. "People want the truth."
It's a message that has so far allowed 69-year-old Kennedy to become, in the six weeks since announcing his long-shot campaign, President Biden's most surprising and successful competitor. With only 38 percent of Democratic voters wanting to see the president as their nominee, Kennedy has polled about as high in the national Democratic primary race as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is polling in the Republican one, despite a fraction of the media coverage and little paid advertising.
Kennedy's campaign aims to embrace the spirit of his family's 1960 and 1968 campaigns, hoping to unite working-class White supporters of former president Donald Trump with the Black and Hispanic coalition of Democrats that once rallied behind the Kennedy name. He argues that national polling does not yet account for the shifts he can bring to who votes in open Democratic primaries. An independent group, American Values 2024, has already raised $5.7 million to support his campaign, according to John Gilmore, the founder of the group.
"This has been a vertical takeoff," said former Democratic Ohio congressman Dennis Kucinich, his campaign manager, who peaked in the single digits as a presidential contender in 2008. "Mr. Kennedy has arrived at a moment of a seismic shift in American politics, and he is singularly situated to be able to reset the pointer of our national dialogue to the center."
Just what is fueling the rockets, however, remains a matter of speculation. An unrelated Robert Kennedy Jr. filed to run in 2017 as a Democrat for a special election to replace one of Alabama's U.S. senators. With little public exposure and a famous name, he led early polls in the race, before losing by 48 points.
A recent CNN poll found that 20 percent of Democratic voters support Kennedy as a presidential candidate and that an additional 44 percent would consider supporting him. Of that second group, 1 in 5 said the Kennedy name and family ties were the main reasons for their consideration.
The Democratic National Committee has been working with Biden's team on his reelection campaign and has not engaged publicly with either Kennedy or author Marianne Williamson, another Democrat running for president. Democratic officials say they will not schedule primary debates. Both the Biden campaign and the DNC declined to comment for this article.
No one yet knows how the nation or the party will react when they find out more about Kennedy's unconventional politics. He has not yet laid out an immigration strategy and is unsure about whether transgender surgeries for youth should be banned, though he opposes trans women competing in women's sports. He says he supports abortion rights and won't cut Social Security or Medicaid, but refuses to say whether he would support an assault weapons ban, since "the control of weapons has to be done through consensus."
He denounces Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, but also blames Americans for provoking the war by supporting the 2014 popular uprising in the country. Like Trump, he says he would quickly negotiate a peace if elected. Unlike most Democrats, he has called former Fox News host Tucker Carlson "breathtakingly courageous" for his criticism of drug companies.
Kennedy still believes that then-Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) won the 2004 election - which reelected Republican George W. Bush - based largely on a loose analysis of exit polls, voting machines and precinct vote counts, echoing the kind of false claims made by Trump and his supporters about the 2020 election. As for the 2020 race, which Biden won, he said, "I don't know. I think that Biden won."
He dismisses concerns that his candidacy could help Trump or another Republican win. Kennedy has suggested that he will not support Biden - whom he calls a friend - as the nominee because of his approach to the Ukraine war. Kennedy acknowledges that some in his family - which has multiple members who serve in the Biden administration - disapprove of his candidacy and views.
"Conspiracies do happen," he said. "It's not that everybody is involved in promoting what they know to be a lie. It is that there are orthodoxies that become institutionalized that have their own gravity that pull people in."
'His entire worldview has become a conspiracy theory' The conspiratorial style of politics - the idea that the powerful secretly shape events with malevolent goals - runs like white noise through American history, punctuated by occasional revelations of actual schemes that did demonstrable harm, such as in the Catholic Church, the tobacco industry or the intelligence community.
The steady hum of popular paranoia has only risen in volume in recent decades, as Gallup has documented record-low trust in institutions like Congress, business, newspapers and the criminal justice system. New conspiracies now anchor mainstream ideologies. Trump blames "the deep state" for his troubles. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) points to the "ultrarich." DeSantis describes a corporate, regulatory, academic and media elite surreptitiously spreading the "woke mind virus."
Kennedy approaches the arena as a decorated outcast - one of the most famous living descendants of the most famous American political dynasty, who has spent the last several years railing against what he sees as a concerted effort to banish him from the public square.
He was stripped of his Instagram account in 2021 for what the company called "debunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines"; the site reinstated his account Sunday in light of his status as a presidential candidate. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) asked Amazon to stop recommending his books. The White House press secretary flagged him as member of the "disinformation dozen" for his flimsy conjectures about covid, such as the unsubstantiated claim that the death of 86-year-old baseball legend Hank Aaron - attributed to natural causes two weeks after a vaccination - was "suspicious." (Kennedy still calls for an "impartial investigation.")
It's all an inside joke for many of his supporters. When an evacuation alarm interrupted Kennedy's April 19 campaign launch at the Park Plaza Hotel in Boston, he addressed the unseen forces arrayed against him.
"Nice try," he said to no one in particular, while pointing to the ceiling, earning laughter and applause. The crowd stayed put.
Partial to the skinny ties of the 1960s, he speaks of backroom power as a person born inside. He recalls his life as a young boy, when his father asked CIA leadership to find out if they had killed his brother, a story he sources to historians. (Arthur Schlesinger Jr., who worked for President John F. Kennedy, reported that then-Attorney General Bobby Kennedy had relayed a version of this story to another adviser.) Kennedy Jr. met with his father's convicted killer, Sirhan Sirhan, after concluding there was evidence of a second shooter at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.
After his father's death, he became friends with Roger Ailes, the now-deceased former head of Fox News, who he claims once told him that he would fire any television anchor who reported about the dangers of vaccines because of pharmaceutical company pressure. Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho) was a friend when the senator ran an investigation that exposed many of the CIA's deepest secrets in the 1970s.
"His wife was my sister's godmother," he said. "I know all of these people."
Of the 11 children born to his parents, Kennedy was blessed with the looks and the name, but little about his first decades suggested an interest in pursuing a life of public office. A master falconer who struggled through school, he launched a career as a successful environmental rights attorney, for the Hudson River Fishermen's Association and then Riverkeeper, before turning his attention in the early 2000s to abuses of the public trust he believed existed in the regulation of pharmaceuticals and vaccines. He now lives in California with his third wife, actress Cheryl Hines, and has six children.
He authored a 2005 article for Rolling Stone and Salon.com alleging that mercury in vaccines had caused a rise in neurological disorders like autism; it was later withdrawn by both publications after multiple corrections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has posted a two-page explainer to debunk claims of mercury harm in vaccines, citing nine studies, including six that were published after his article.
Kennedy has not changed his view, though he now says mercury was likely just one of many toxins that caused the disorders. "They are all epidemiological studies, which are the easiest studies to fix," he said in Indianapolis when presented with the CDC document. "I did a whole book on it, where I digested, I think, 450 studies and 1,400 references."
Most scientists view such talk as nonsense, in part because most mercury was voluntarily removed from or reduced in childhood vaccines about two decades ago, while autism diagnoses have continued to rise since then, said David Gorski, an oncologist at Wayne State University School of Medicine who edits Science-Based Medicine, a website focused on debunking medical conspiracy theories.
Kennedy argues that an increase in flu vaccinations with mercury preservative could have counteracted this shift. "It's hard to write anything I say about vaccines," he admits, nodding to the complexity. "It's layer upon layer and argument upon argument."
His opponents have a simpler explanation. "His entire worldview has become a conspiracy theory. He has spent the last 18-plus years spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt about vaccines," Gorski said. "He is just more respectable because he is a Kennedy."
Kennedy's claims about coronavirus vaccines tend to spark the fiercest backlash. The mRNA vaccines were found to be more than 95 percent protective against symptomatic illness of early strains of covid during the clinical trials. Follow-up studies found them highly effective against severe illness and death, said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor University.
"Those Americans who perished from covid were overwhelmingly among the unvaccinated," Hotez said in an email, referring to the period after vaccine distribution.
But Kennedy is unfazed, plowing ahead in a raspy voice - the result of spasmodic dysphonia, an unexplained condition of the vocal muscles he has speculated may be a side effect of the flu vaccine. He never took the coronavirus vaccine, convinced early on that a bigger fix was at play.
He said technology companies like Amazon, whose founder Jeff Bezos owns The Post, supported lockdowns and limited dissenting views because they stood to profit from isolation. Kennedy's nonprofit organization, the Children's Health Defense, has sued The Post and other news outlets alleging that they violated antitrust laws by working with technology companies on an initiative to fight misinformation. A spokeswoman for The Post declined to comment on the suit.
"It was like a minor hangover," he said of his own experience catching the virus.
In his announcement speech, he joked that he had "a rambunctious youth and it lasted until my early sixties." Arrested for heroin possession at 28, he stayed sober for 25 years, until 2014, when he started counting again after taking pain medication for a medical procedure, he said. To this day, even as he travels for the campaign, he regularly attends 12-step meetings to maintain his sobriety. "Like nine meetings a week," he said.
"If somebody believes that my heroin addiction four decades ago should exclude me from the White House, they're entitled to that, or all the other stuff that I had," he said when asked how voters should interpret his unusual presidential profile. "I don't begrudge anybody."
A unified theory of American deception Kennedy's invitation to speak at a golf club in Indianapolis came from the First Principles Forum, a group founded to seek a "return to civil discourse," according to the program. Previous speakers have included conservative podcasters Matt Walsh, who refers to himself as a "theocratic fascist" on Twitter; Candace Owens, the founder of a group aimed at helping Blacks "escape from the Democratic plantation"; and Charlie Kirk, the founder of the right-wing group Turning Point USA.
A common theme among the speakers is a conviction that major news organizations no longer share an accurate picture of what is happening.
"Never take a headline or what you see on the news at face value," said Fanchon Stinger, the evening news anchor of a local Fox affiliate who introduced Kennedy to the audience. " Once we have a media or a mainstream organization that's taking those basic freedoms away, we can no longer make educated decisions for our families and for our loved ones."
In his speech, Kennedy offered a unified narrative of American deception, connecting covid and the Bay of Pigs, the collapse of mom-and-pop stores and federal investment in mind-control research. The common theme was a quest for profit at the expense of the middle class, driven by the corruption of intelligence and regulatory agencies.
The pandemic, he argued, originated at a U.S.-funded lab in China - a point of disagreement within the U.S. government - in a program he suggested was possible because of the 2001 Patriot Act, which he then claimed passed only after two holdout Democratic senators, Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont and Tom Daschle of South Dakota, were threatened with death.
"A week into that debate both of them received anthrax envelopes in the mail, and Congress was shut down, and the Patriot Act was passed," Kennedy said - a sentence with a factual error undergirding an implied-but-unsupported claim of cause and effect.
The crowd started to laugh knowingly when Kennedy added that the government scientist alleged by the FBI to have sent those letters "committed suicide - supposedly."
In fact, the Leahy anthrax letter was discovered in a batch of unopened mail on Nov. 16, 2001, weeks after the Patriot Act's passage, which had been preceded by six weeks of debate in the Senate. (An aide to Leahy said Kennedy's timeline doesn't make sense. Daschle did not respond to a request for comment.) The Patriot Act - with the support of his uncle, the now-deceased Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) - added a second exception for "bona fide research" in the bioweapons chapter of the U.S. criminal code.
Kennedy speaks frequently on anti-establishment podcasts and in conservative media, where he has been received warmly. He welcomed Elon Musk's public invitation to do a Twitter Spaces event this week, and circulated a link to a sympathetic online Fox News documentary about his life. Fox host Sean Hannity introduced Kennedy on his show in May by describing his polling as "nightmare new numbers for Joe Biden." When Kennedy appeared on Fox host Laura Ingraham's show, the chryon announced that he could "throw a wrench in Biden's campaign."
Kennedy has argued, based on circumstantial evidence, that the CIA continues to influence domestic political news coverage, even naming liberal-leaning outlets that have previously published his writing as likely victims.
"There's kind of an Overton window that always exists in the media where there's certain things you can't repeat," he said , a reference to a theory by political scientist Joseph Overton that the bounds of acceptable discourse can shift over time. "But that Overton window got very constricted during the pandemic. And the consequences for venturing out of it became, you know, lethal to careers."
Attendees at his event who took his words at face value may have left with the impression that the anthrax letters led their intended recipients to support the Patriot Act. But just hours earlier, in the interview with The Post, Kennedy had said he did not know if there was a direct relationship between the anthrax letters and their votes.
"What I am saying is that the whole story was not the story we were given at the time," Kennedy explained. "I don't even know how they cast their votes."
In this way, the central theme of Kennedy's presidential campaign can overwhelm the details. Dots can appear to connect even when the connections are not directly drawn.
Kennedy ended his speech by recounting the 1960s obedience experiments by Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram, which were funded by the National Science Foundation, but which Kennedy said, without offering evidence, were actually part of the CIA's mind-control research program. (He has previously attributed this claim to University of Wisconsin historian Alfred McCoy, who has made a circumstantial case of CIA interest.)
In the experiments, college students were asked by a man in a lab coat to shock people in an adjoining room at increasing levels of electricity, even though no shocks were actually administered. An actor, on the other side of the wall, would scream in pain to suggest a result.
The experiment found that about two-thirds of test subjects were willing to put a stranger's life in danger at the instruction of an authority figure. About one-third refused to do as they were told.
"It's occurred to me many times during the pandemic that we're in the middle of a huge Milgram experiment," he said. "The people in this room - that's the 33 percent. For the people who didn't walk out, our job is to continue to fight for their freedom until they wake up out of their sleepwalk."
Then Kennedy excused himself for a Fox News appearance across town. Once pushed from the spotlight, he had places to be.

It's all an inside joke for many of his supporters. When an evacuation alarm interrupted Kennedy's April 19 campaign launch at the Park Plaza Hotel in Boston, he addressed the unseen forces arrayed against him.
"Nice try," he said to no one in particular, while pointing to the ceiling, earning laughter and applause. The crowd stayed put.
Partial to the skinny ties of the 1960s, he speaks of backroom power as a person born inside. He recalls his life as a young boy, when his father asked CIA leadership to find out if they had killed his brother, a story he sources to historians. (Arthur Schlesinger Jr., who worked for President John F. Kennedy, reported that then-Attorney General Bobby Kennedy had relayed a version of this story to another adviser.) Kennedy Jr. met with his father's convicted killer, Sirhan Sirhan, after concluding there was evidence of a second shooter at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.
After his father's death, he became friends with Roger Ailes, the now-deceased former head of Fox News, who he claims once told him that he would fire any television anchor who reported about the dangers of vaccines because of pharmaceutical company pressure. Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho) was a friend when the senator ran an investigation that exposed many of the CIA's deepest secrets in the 1970s.
"His wife was my sister's godmother," he said. "I know all of these people."
Of the 11 children born to his parents, Kennedy was blessed with the looks and the name, but little about his first decades suggested an interest in pursuing a life of public office. A master falconer who struggled through school, he launched a career as a successful environmental rights attorney, for the Hudson River Fishermen's Association and then Riverkeeper, before turning his attention in the early 2000s to abuses of the public trust he believed existed in the regulation of pharmaceuticals and vaccines. He now lives in California with his third wife, actress Cheryl Hines, and has six children.
He authored a 2005 article for Rolling Stone and Salon.com alleging that mercury in vaccines had caused a rise in neurological disorders like autism; it was later withdrawn by both publications after multiple corrections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has posted a two-page explainer to debunk claims of mercury harm in vaccines, citing nine studies, including six that were published after his article.
Kennedy has not changed his view, though he now says that mercury was probably just one of many toxins that caused the disorders. "They are all epidemiological studies, which are the easiest studies to fix," he said in Indianapolis when presented with the CDC document. "I did a whole book on it, where I digested, I think, 450 studies and 1,400 references."
Most scientists view such talk as nonsense, in part because most mercury was voluntarily removed from or reduced in childhood vaccines about two decades ago, while autism diagnoses have continued to rise since then, said David Gorski, an oncologist at Wayne State University School of Medicine who edits Science-Based Medicine, a website focused on debunking medical conspiracy theories.
Kennedy argues that an increase in flu vaccinations with mercury preservative could have counteracted this shift. "It's hard to write anything I say about vaccines," he admits, nodding to the complexity. "It's layer upon layer and argument upon argument."
His opponents have a simpler explanation. "His entire worldview has become a conspiracy theory. He has spent the last 18-plus years spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt about vaccines," Gorski said. "He is just more respectable because he is a Kennedy."
Kennedy's claims about coronavirus vaccines tend to spark the fiercest backlash. The mRNA vaccines were found to be more than 95 percent protective against symptomatic illness of early strains of covid during the clinical trials. Follow-up studies found them highly effective against severe illness and death, said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor University.
"Those Americans who perished from covid were overwhelmingly among the unvaccinated," Hotez said in an email, referring to the period after vaccine distribution.
But Kennedy is unfazed, plowing ahead in a raspy voice — the result of spasmodic dysphonia, an unexplained condition of the vocal muscles he has speculated may be a side effect of the flu vaccine. He never took the coronavirus vaccine, convinced early on that a bigger fix was at play.
He said technology companies like Amazon, whose founder Jeff Bezos owns The Post, supported lockdowns and limited dissenting views because they stood to profit from isolation. Kennedy's nonprofit organization, the Children's Health Defense, has sued The Post and other news outlets alleging that they violated antitrust laws by working with technology companies on an initiative to fight misinformation. A spokeswoman for The Post declined to comment on the suit.
"It was like a minor hangover," he said of his own experience catching the virus.
In his announcement speech, he joked that he had "a rambunctious youth and it lasted until my early sixties." Arrested for heroin possession at 28, he stayed sober for 25 years, until 2014, when he started counting again after taking pain medication for a medical procedure, he said. To this day, even as he travels for the campaign, he regularly attends 12-step meetings to maintain his sobriety. "Like nine meetings a week," he said.
"If somebody believes that my heroin addiction four decades ago should exclude me from the White House, they're entitled to that, or all the other stuff that I had," he said, when asked how voters should interpret his unusual presidential profile. "I don't begrudge anybody."
A unified theory of American deception Kennedy's invitation to speak at a golf club in Indianapolis came from the First Principles Forum, a group founded to seek a "return to civil discourse," according to the program. Previous speakers have included conservative podcaster Matt Walsh, who refers to himself as a "theocratic fascist" on Twitter; Candace Owens, the founder of a group aimed at helping Blacks "escape from the Democratic plantation"; and Charlie Kirk, the founder of the right-wing group Turning Point USA.
A common theme among the speakers is a conviction that major news organizations no longer share an accurate picture of what is happening.
"Never take a headline or what you see on the news at face value," said Fanchon Stinger, the evening news anchor of a local Fox affiliate who introduced Kennedy to the audience. "Once we have a media or a mainstream organization that's taking those basic freedoms away, we can no longer make educated decisions for our families and for our loved ones."
In his speech, Kennedy offered a unified narrative of American deception, connecting covid and the Bay of Pigs, the collapse of mom-and-pop stores and federal investment in mind-control research. The common theme was a quest for profit at the expense of the middle class, driven by the corruption of intelligence and regulatory agencies.
The pandemic, he argued, originated at a U.S.-funded lab in China — a point of disagreement within the U.S. government — in a program he suggested was possible because of the 2001 Patriot Act, which he then claimed passed only after two holdout Democratic senators, Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont and Tom Daschle of South Dakota, were threatened with death.
"A week into that debate both of them received anthrax envelopes in the mail, and Congress was shut down, and the Patriot Act was passed," Kennedy said — a sentence with a factual error undergirding an implied-but-unsupported claim of cause and effect.
The crowd started to laugh knowingly when Kennedy added that the government scientist alleged by the FBI to have sent those letters "committed suicide — supposedly."
In fact, the Leahy anthrax letter was discovered in a batch of unopened mail only on Nov. 16, 2001, weeks after the Patriot Act's passage, which had been preceded by six weeks of debate in the Senate. (An aide to Leahy said Kennedy's timeline doesn't make sense. Daschle did not respond to a request for comment.) The Patriot Act, with the support of his uncle, the now-deceased Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), added a second exception for "bona fide research" in the bioweapons chapter of the U.S. criminal code.
Kennedy speaks frequently on anti-establishment podcasts and in conservative media, where he has been received warmly. He welcomed Elon Musk's public invitation to do a Twitter Spaces event on Monday, and circulated a link to a sympathetic online Fox News documentary about his life. Fox host Sean Hannity introduced Kennedy on his show in May by describing his polling as "nightmare new numbers for Joe Biden." When Kennedy appeared on Fox host Laura Ingraham's show, the chryon announced he could "throw a wrench in Biden's campaign."
Kennedy has argued, based on circumstantial evidence, that the CIA continues to influence domestic political news coverage, even naming liberal-leaning outlets that have previously published his writing as likely victims.
"There's kind of an Overton window that always exists in the media where there's certain things you can't repeat," he said , a reference to a theory by political scientist Joseph Overton that the bounds of acceptable discourse can shift over time. "But that Overton window got very constricted during the pandemic. And the consequences for venturing out of it became, you know, lethal to careers."
Attendees at his event who took his words at face value may have left with the impression that the anthrax letters led their intended recipients to support the Patriot Act. But just hours earlier, in the interview with The Post, Kennedy had said he did not know if there was a direct relationship between the anthrax letters and their votes.
"What I am saying is that the whole story was not the story we were given at the time," Kennedy explained. "I don't even know how they cast their votes."
In this way, the central theme of Kennedy's presidential campaign can overwhelm the details. Dots can appear to connect even when the connections are not directly drawn.
Kennedy ended his speech by recounting the 1960s obedience experiments by Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram, which were funded by the National Science Foundation, but which Kennedy said, without offering evidence, were actually part of the CIA's mind-control research program. (He has previously attributed this claim to University of Wisconsin historian Alfred McCoy, who has made a circumstantial case of CIA interest.)
In the experiments, college students were asked by a man in a lab coat to shock people in an adjoining room at increasing levels of electricity, even though no shocks were actually administered. An actor, on the other side of the wall, would scream in pain to suggest a result.
The experiment found that about two-thirds of test subjects were willing to put a stranger's life in danger at the instruction of an authority figure. About one-third refused to do as they were told.
"It's occurred to me many times during the pandemic that we're in the middle of a huge Milgram experiment," he said. "The people in this room — that's the 33 percent. For the people who didn't walk out, our job is to continue to fight for their freedom until they wake up out of their sleepwalk."
Then Kennedy excused himself for a Fox News appearance across town. Once pushed from the spotlight, he had places to be.

Full text: NEW YORK - An exiled Chinese tycoon indicted in New York earlier this month in a billion-dollar fraud case controls the conservative social media platform Gettr and used it to promote cryptocurrencies and propaganda, former employees have told The Washington Post.
They said the arrested expatriate, Guo Wengui, and his longtime money manager, William Je, called the shots at the company while Donald Trump senior adviser Jason Miller was its chief executive and public face. Miller served in that capacity from before Gettr's July 4, 2021, launch until this month, when he returned to work on his third Trump presidential campaign.
Gettr doled out tens of thousands of dollars to right-wing figures including Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon, sent money to contractors affiliated with Guo, and altered information on Gettr users that law enforcement agencies had sought, according to the former employees and internal company documents obtained by The Post.
The revelations show that a man accused of massive fraud on two continents climbed high into Trump's political sphere and dictated messaging at a social media site that reaches millions of Americans.
Guo was arrested March 15 at his Fifth Avenue penthouse in New York, where a fire broke out as agents hunted for documents. Je, who lives in London, remains at large.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have charged both men with 11 counts of securities and wire fraud, money laundering and related offenses and Je with an additional count of obstruction. The legal documents do not allege any wrongdoing at Gettr; prosecutors did not return a call seeking comment Friday.
Guo was known to have been a Gettr investor, but his dominant financing role and ability to influence hiring and content decisions at the platform have not previously been reported.
Miller has said previously that Guo invested in Gettr indirectly through a family foundation and that an international fund was another part-owner. But two former Gettr employees told The Post that Miller told them that the international fund was Hamilton Investment Management, where Je is founder and chief executive.
Miller "publicly mentioned an international investment fund. To me, he specified the name Hamilton Investments," Ben Badejo, Gettr's former director of trust and safety, said in an interview.
The second former employee, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation, said that they had asked Miller about Guo's backing before joining the company and that Miller misled them by saying Guo had an indirect, minority stake. They said that after they had been working there for a time, Miller said another significant investor was Hamilton.
"He had this line, 'Gettr is backed by an international consortium of investors.' It was very clear it was not true. I don't think there was any other investor. I would have known," the person said.
Now claiming nearly 7.5 million users, Gettr was among the conservative alternatives to Twitter, along with Trump's own Truth Social, that sprang up after the major platforms banned Trump's accounts following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Gettr had 3.1 million page visits in January, down from 5.4 million in November, according to SimilarWeb. The same period saw Truth Social fall to 5.7 million from 8.3 million.
Miller declined to answer questions about Gettr and its financing, referring questions to the company's chief financial officer, Robin Mokhtar, who did not respond to a phone call and email seeking comment. Gettr did not reply to an email sent to its public relations department.
Attorneys for Guo did not respond to a request for comment and have given no statement in court or in public since the indictment. Je spokesman Richard Merrin declined to answer questions about Gettr, saying only: "Mr. Je is deeply disappointed to learn of the actions by the United States Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission initiated last week. Mr. Je vehemently denies all the allegations in these actions."
According to the recent indictment and the Securities and Exchange Commission, Guo duped thousands of his followers into investing in private stock sales of his companies or cryptocurrencies, then spent much of the money on himself, including $40 million on a New Jersey mansion, nearly $1 million on rugs and $53,000 on a fireplace log holder. Though the filings focus on Guo's other networks, Guo also promoted digital currencies via Twitter and live streams on Gettr.
Federal agents seized more than $300 million in bank accounts marked Hamilton Opportunity Fund or Hamilton Opportunity Funds in a forfeiture proceeding. They also took another $2.7 million from an account marked Gettr USA, without saying who controlled it, court documents show.
Gettr played up its Americanness from the beginning, launching on Independence Day. The site declares that it "champions free speech, rejects cancel-culture, and provides a best-in-class technology platform for the marketplace of ideas."
Internally, it prioritized U.S. politics, according to an undated internal spreadsheet that tracked how much it paid influencers to post on its network and attract new users.
Over varying periods ending as late as December 2022, Bannon's War Room podcast received $50,000, according to a screenshot of the spreadsheet Badejo gave to The Post. It was the largest sum of 18 payment streams listed. Bannon did not respond to requests for comment.
Turning Point USA leader Charlie Kirk's Resolute Media received $18,000, according to the document. About $15,000 each went to firms marked as connected to well-known conservative commentators Dinesh D'Souza and Jack Posobiec and to British rightist Tommy Robinson, the document said. Smaller amounts went to the podcasting duo of Lynette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, known as Diamond and Silk, and to activist Andy Ngo. Kirk, D'Souza, Posobiec, Richardson and Ngo did not respond to requests for comment. Robinson could not be reached.
The former employees said they were unnerved that the money for Gettr came from a foreigner, especially because some exiles have accused Guo of being a double agent for the Chinese government working at co-opting opposition, noting that he was close to high officials before leaving.
"It's really kind of scary how a Chinese billionaire can create this," the second former staffer said. "It's important that this is talked about as a potential national security issue."
Also known as Miles Guo, Miles Kwok and Brother Seven, Guo made a fortune in mainland China real estate development before coming under government scrutiny there and fleeing to the United States ahead of fraud and bribery charges. Since then, he has positioned himself as a leading foe of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, amassing hundreds of thousands of followers on various platforms, including his own. Guo's networks have also promoted Trump, QAnon conspiracy theories and false claims about coronavirus vaccines and treatments, The Post has reported.
"The network stands out for its cross-platform coordination, breadth of technological sophistication, ideological alignment, and sheer output of high-quality content," said disinformation analyst Kyle Weiss of Graphika, which tracks propaganda networks for social media companies. He said Guo sets the messaging, which is amplified by affiliated media outlets such as GNews and GTV and then followers coordinating on Discord, GitHub and elsewhere using thousands of social media accounts.
In 2021, Graphika reported that Guo had pushed people to attend the Jan. 6 rally, using the #StoptheSteal hashtag. When the attack failed, Guo switched to amplifying claims that the violence that day had been the work of antifa infiltrators, Graphika said.
Guo also has encouraged followers to protest in person against other Chinese expatriates, including other anti-Communists he sees as rivals, and even court officials who have ruled against him.
Guo formed a close alliance with former Trump adviser Bannon; Bannon was arrested on Guo's family yacht in 2020 on fraud charges. He was pardoned by Trump.
At Gettr, Guo's influence extended beyond financial matters to hiring, relationships with other businesses and content decisions, the former employees said. Badejo, who describes himself as a conservative, provided internal emails, instant messages and other documents to back up his claims.
Gettr is based on the 20th floor of 3 Columbus Circle in New York. The same floor houses Guo operations including G Clubs, which prosecutors said was used in the alleged money laundering. Still other Guo operations worked on contract for Gettr or shared resources, and some engineers who worked at Gettr maintained their email addresses at a domain designated "GCoders," which also served other Guo entities, Badejo said.
Many on the Gettr staff were Guo acolytes, the two people said. Guo's presence on the Gettr side of the floor became more frequent toward the end of last year, when he would walk through the Gettr section and post live streams of himself discussing various topics, the second former employee said.
"He would use the same room as Jason," the second person said, and promote various coins and the New Federal State of China, a purported rival government in exile created by Guo and Bannon.
"They would roll out the NFSC backdrop and roll in the Gettr backdrop," they said. "We were all waiting for journalists to figure out what was going on."
One woman who spent most of her time on Guo's side of the floor, Yvette Wang, was also his representative on the Gettr board, both former employees said. They named two other people on the board who work for HCHK Technologies, which Google lists as the developer of Guo's GNews app.
The second employee said they understood the corporate structure to be that Miller reported to the board, which in turn reported to Guo and Je. Wang could not be reached for comment. A lawyer for another Guo company handled some of Gettr's legal issues.
The overlaps made some employees uncomfortable.
A contractor named Orbit did some content moderation and was especially keen to delete anything critical of Guo, the two said.
A customer support contractor called Oasis Tech, meanwhile, had ties to Guo that made Badejo and others cautious. One of two listed shareholders of Oasis under its former name of Seven Stars Media, Xuebing Wang, was also listed as the director for GFashion New Zealand, a Guo company.
After it submitted a monthly invoice for $400,000 with the single line "engineering contractor service," Chief Financial Officer Mokhtar pushed back.
According to an email Badejo shared with The Post, Mokhtar wrote colleagues: "We would like for them to include additional details on their monthly invoice such [as] number, location, name, project, hours etc. of the engineers performing the work. Current invoices, June attached, does not provide enough detail which will definitely be an audit issue."
Whether the invoice was revised or paid is not known. No one at Oasis returned a voice mail left at the phone number listed on the company's website, and Mokhtar did not respond to attempts to contact him.
Though Gettr's funding sources remained opaque to most employees, Miller and other executives were deferential to Guo's representatives and concerned about his opinions, the ex-employees said.
In an alarmed WhatsApp group chat that showed Truth Social's beta version had direct messages before Gettr, Miller told staffers: "Not for sharing, especially not with Miles."
Guo stepped more visibly into Gettr affairs this year, when he began pitching the availability of Gettr Coin, with which Gettr users are supposed to reward other users, the second former employee said. In videos posted to Twitter, Guo touted an early sale of the coins for 10 cents each and discussed them with Ken Huang, Gettr's chief technology officer.
A disclaimer on Gettr's site says the coins have no value and can't be used outside of the platform.
Badejo said he left Gettr in September because of another issue: his belief that Gettr was not providing accurate information to law enforcement about its users.
Gettr sometimes received subpoenas for information about users, including the email addresses with which they had registered accounts and the IP addresses of the computers they had used. Those included a ransomware operator and a user who had posted that he would kill "Judas" former vice president Mike Pence if he got a chance, according to copies of subpoenas Gettr received and those users' posts on Gettr.
Badejo's job included responding to those legal demands, which required him to attest that they were truthful and complete under penalty of perjury.
But he said he discovered that the company had been answering such requests by providing altered IP addresses in which the final sequence of numbers had been replaced with the number zero.
Badejo told Miller and Huang that the practice was putting everyone involved in legal peril.
In a March 2022 Microsoft Teams chat preserved by Badejo, Huang told him that "we have an IP scrubbing job that convert (sic) the 4th octet into 0." He said an upcoming release of the product would preserve the real numbers. But Badejo found messages on other topics that included full IP addresses, which made him nervous.
In an email to a Gettr lawyer, Badejo wrote: "Ken and others in engineering initially said we don't 'collect' full IP addresses, then eventually slipped and said we 'remove' it (after I had submitted DOJ information)." Huang and the lawyer did not respond to emails from The Post seeking comment.
As Badejo added a disclaimer to new responses, he suggested that they warn enforcement offices around the country that the past submissions had incomplete addresses.
Executives never went back and corrected the old responses or told officials of the issue, Badejo said.
He eventually told the FBI about the matter, and he said agents have interviewed him twice since then. The FBI declined to comment on the IP addresses or whether it was looking more closely at Guo's activities at Gettr.
"There was an opportunity to do the right thing, help the Department of Justice and avoid criminal proceedings," Badejo said. "And they just didn't."

Attorneys for Guo did not respond to a request for comment and have given no statement in court or in public since the indictment. Je spokesman Richard Merrin declined to answer questions about Gettr, saying only: "Mr. Je is deeply disappointed to learn of the actions by the United States Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission initiated last week. Mr. Je vehemently denies all the allegations in these actions."
According to the recent indictment and the Securities and Exchange Commission, Guo duped thousands of his followers into investing in private stock sales of his companies or cryptocurrencies, then spent much of the money on himself, including $40 million on a New Jersey mansion, nearly $1 million on rugs and $53,000 on a fireplace log holder. Though the filings focus on Guo's other networks, Guo also promoted digital currencies via Twitter and live streams on Gettr.
Federal agents seized more than $300 million in bank accounts marked Hamilton Opportunity Fund or Hamilton Opportunity Funds in a forfeiture proceeding. They also took another $2.7 million from an account marked Gettr USA, without saying who controlled it, court documents show.
Gettr played up its Americanness from the beginning, launching on Independence Day. The site declares that it "champions free speech, rejects cancel-culture, and provides a best-in-class technology platform for the marketplace of ideas."
Internally, it prioritized U.S. politics, according to an undated internal spreadsheet that tracked how much it paid influencers to post on its network and attract new users.
Over varying periods ending as late as December 2022, Bannon's War Room podcast received $50,000, according to a screenshot of the spreadsheet Badejo gave to The Post. It was the largest sum of 18 payment streams listed. Bannon did not respond to requests for comment.
Turning Point USA leader Charlie Kirk's Resolute Media received $18,000, according to the document. About $15,000 each went to firms marked as connected to well-known conservative commentators Dinesh D'Souza and Jack Posobiec and to British rightist Tommy Robinson, the document said. Smaller amounts went to the podcasting duo of Lynette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, known as Diamond and Silk, and to activist Andy Ngo. Kirk, D'Souza, Posobiec, Richardson and Ngo did not respond to requests for comment. Robinson could not be reached.
The former employees said they were unnerved that the money for Gettr came from a foreigner, especially because some exiles have accused Guo of being a double agent for the Chinese government working at co-opting opposition, noting that he was close to high officials before leaving.
"It's really kind of scary how a Chinese billionaire can create this," the second former staffer said. "It's important that this is talked about as a potential national security issue."
Also known as Miles Guo, Miles Kwok and Brother Seven, Guo made a fortune in mainland China real estate development before coming under government scrutiny there and fleeing to the United States ahead of fraud and bribery charges. Since then, he has positioned himself as a leading foe of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, amassing hundreds of thousands of followers on various platforms, including his own. Guo's networks have also promoted Trump, QAnon conspiracy theories and false claims about coronavirus vaccines and treatments, The Post has reported.
"The network stands out for its cross-platform coordination, breadth of technological sophistication, ideological alignment, and sheer output of high-quality content," said disinformation analyst Kyle Weiss of Graphika, which tracks propaganda networks for social media companies. He said Guo sets the messaging, which is amplified by affiliated media outlets such as GNews and GTV and then followers coordinating on Discord, GitHub and elsewhere using thousands of social media accounts.
In 2021, Graphika reported that Guo had pushed people to attend the Jan. 6 rally, using the #StoptheSteal hashtag. When the attack failed, Guo switched to amplifying claims that the violence that day had been the work of antifa infiltrators, Graphika said.
Guo also has encouraged followers to protest in person against other Chinese expatriates, including other anti-Communists he sees as rivals, and even court officials who have ruled against him.
Guo formed a close alliance with former Trump adviser Bannon; Bannon was arrested on Guo's family yacht in 2020 on fraud charges. He was pardoned by Trump.
At Gettr, Guo's influence extended beyond financial matters to hiring, relationships with other businesses and content decisions, the former employees said. Badejo, who describes himself as a conservative, provided internal emails, instant messages and other documents to back up his claims.
Gettr is based on the 20th floor of 3 Columbus Circle in New York. The same floor houses Guo operations including G Clubs, which prosecutors said was used in the alleged money laundering. Still other Guo operations worked on contract for Gettr or shared resources, and some engineers who worked at Gettr maintained their email addresses at a domain designated "GCoders," which also served other Guo entities, Badejo said.
Many on the Gettr staff were Guo acolytes, the two people said. Guo's presence on the Gettr side of the floor became more frequent toward the end of last year, when he would walk through the Gettr section and post live streams of himself discussing various topics, the second former employee said.
"He would use the same room as Jason," the second person said, and promote various coins and the New Federal State of China, a purported rival government in exile created by Guo and Bannon.
"They would roll out the NFSC backdrop and roll in the Gettr backdrop," they said. "We were all waiting for journalists to figure out what was going on."
One woman who spent most of her time on Guo's side of the floor, Yvette Wang, was also his representative on the Gettr board, both former employees said. They named two other people on the board who work for HCHK Technologies, which Google lists as the developer of Guo's GNews app.
The second employee said they understood the corporate structure to be that Miller reported to the board, which in turn reported to Guo and Je. Wang could not be reached for comment. A lawyer for another Guo company handled some of Gettr's legal issues.
The overlaps made some employees uncomfortable.
A contractor named Orbit did some content moderation and was especially keen to delete anything critical of Guo, the two said.
A customer support contractor called Oasis Tech, meanwhile, had ties to Guo that made Badejo and others cautious. One of two listed shareholders of Oasis under its former name of Seven Stars Media, Xuebing Wang, was also listed as the director for GFashion New Zealand, a Guo company.
After it submitted a monthly invoice for $400,000 with the single line "engineering contractor service," Chief Financial Officer Mokhtar pushed back.
According to an email Badejo shared with The Post, Mokhtar wrote colleagues: "We would like for them to include additional details on their monthly invoice such [as] number, location, name, project, hours etc. of the engineers performing the work. Current invoices, June attached, does not provide enough detail which will definitely be an audit issue."
Whether the invoice was revised or paid is not known. No one at Oasis returned a voice mail left at the phone number listed on the company's website, and Mokhtar did not respond to attempts to contact him.
Though Gettr's funding sources remained opaque to most employees, Miller and other executives were deferential to Guo's representatives and concerned about his opinions, the ex-employees said.
In an alarmed WhatsApp group chat that showed Truth Social's beta version had direct messages before Gettr, Miller told staffers: "Not for sharing, especially not with Miles."
Guo stepped more visibly into Gettr affairs this year, when he began pitching the availability of Gettr Coin, with which Gettr users are supposed to reward other users, the second former employee said. In videos posted to Twitter, Guo touted an early sale of the coins for 10 cents each and discussed them with Ken Huang, Gettr's chief technology officer.
A disclaimer on Gettr's site says the coins have no value and can't be used outside of the platform.
Badejo said he left Gettr in September because of another issue: his belief that Gettr was not providing accurate information to law enforcement about its users.
Gettr sometimes received subpoenas for information about users, including the email addresses with which they had registered accounts and the IP addresses of the computers they had used. Those included a ransomware operator and a user who had posted that he would kill "Judas" former vice president Mike Pence if he got a chance, according to copies of subpoenas Gettr received and those users' posts on Gettr.
Badejo's job included responding to those legal demands, which required him to attest that they were truthful and complete under penalty of perjury.
But he said he discovered that the company had been answering such requests by providing altered IP addresses in which the final sequence of numbers had been replaced with the number zero.
Badejo told Miller and Huang that the practice was putting everyone involved in legal peril.
In a March 2022 Microsoft Teams chat preserved by Badejo, Huang told him that "we have an IP scrubbing job that convert (sic) the 4th octet into 0." He said an upcoming release of the product would preserve the real numbers. But Badejo found messages on other topics that included full IP addresses, which made him nervous.
In an email to a Gettr lawyer, Badejo wrote: "Ken and others in engineering initially said we don't 'collect' full IP addresses, then eventually slipped and said we 'remove' it (after I had submitted DOJ information)." Huang and the lawyer did not respond to emails from The Post seeking comment.
As Badejo added a disclaimer to new responses, he suggested that they warn enforcement offices around the country that the past submissions had incomplete addresses.
Executives never went back and corrected the old responses or told officials of the issue, Badejo said. He eventually told the FBI about the matter, and he said agents have interviewed him twice since then. The FBI declined to comment on the IP addresses or whether it was looking more closely at Guo's activities at Gettr.
"There was an opportunity to do the right thing, help the Department of Justice and avoid criminal proceedings," Badejo said. "And they just didn't."

Full text: More than a dozen candidates are running for president in 2024, most of them on the Republican side. Former president Donald Trump is the overwhelming polling leader for the GOP nomination, even as he faces four indictments and trials set to collide with key dates in the election cycle.
President Biden is running again on the Democratic side, where two other long-shot candidates have also announced their campaigns.
Announcements timeline
Republicans CandidateHeader Trump
Prominent Republicans appeared newly willing to criticize Trump after the midterms, with some openly blaming the former president for elevating flawed candidates. But Trump has only pulled further ahead of his rivals this year as Republicans rally to his defense after state and federal indictments. In New York, he's accused of falsifying business records; in Georgia and in federal court, he and many associates face charges stemming from their efforts to overturn the 2020 election; and an additional federal case targets Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents from his time in the White House.
In speeches, Trump has repeated his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and cast the charges against him as the latest effort to thwart him. "For those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution," he declared at the Conservative Political Action Conference.

Burgum header
North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum announced a long-shot presidential run in June. The wealthy tech entrepreneur turned governor was first elected to his job in 2016, when he won a three-way race with nearly 77 percent of the vote.
In his campaign launch in Fargo, Burgum outlined an agenda focused on his plans to help the nation adapt to a rapidly changing economy, expand domestic energy production and address the most pressing national security threats. "Woke was what you did at 5 a.m. to start the day" growing up in a tiny town in North Dakota, he said in a video teasing his kickoff.
End of nest
Christie header
Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie has positioned himself as a bare-knuckled brawler best-equipped to make the case against Trump, his onetime ally. He served as governor of New Jersey from 2010 to 2018 and also ran for president in 2016.
Christie endorsed Trump quickly in 2016 after dropping out of the race and led Trump's transition team, but he later grew critical of Trump and has made some of the bluntest calls for his party to shift direction. At a Las Vegas meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition last year , Christie compared politicians' fear of Trump to their fear of being branded a communist in the 1960s amid "litmus tests based on lies."
End of nest
DeSantis header
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis began the year with high expectations after a landslide reelection, widely viewed as the most formidable primary challenger to his former ally Trump. But he's lost significant ground to Trump since then and polls a distant second. Along the way he's replaced his campaign manager, alienated some major donors and laid off a large chunk of his staff. Now he's banking on a strong showing in Iowa, the first-in-the-nation caucus state where a pro-DeSantis super PAC is investing heavily.
As governor, DeSantis built national name-recognition opposing pandemic-driven shutdowns and vaccine mandates and cast himself as an enemy of what he calls "woke ideology" in the news media, major companies such as Disney and schools, where he has worked to restrict discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity. He is pitching himself as a better bet than Trump to beat Biden in the swing states that will decide the election. At the same time, some Republicans worry he's gone too far to the right on issues such as abortion.
End of nest
Elder header
Larry Elder, a conservative talk radio host who unsuccessfully sought to unseat Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) in California's 2021 recall election, announced in April that he is running for the Republican nomination for president. During his bid for governor, Elder opposed the minimum wage, called to let employers ask female applicants whether they plan to get pregnant, rejected the coronavirus vaccine mandate for state workers and endorsed Trump's false assertion that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent.

Candidate header haley
Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who later served as Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, would be the first woman and the first Asian American GOP presidential nominee. She has called for "a new generation of leadership" and highlighted her gender and her family's immigrant roots while rejecting "identity politics." Haley has struggled to break out but grabbed attention with her performance at the first Republican debate, making direct jabs at Trump and tangling sharply with rival Vivek Ramaswamy over foreign policy.
Haley has distanced herself from Trump at times, saying in 2021 that his post-election actions "will be judged harshly by history," but said later that year that she would not run if Trump did. In an interview early this year with Fox News, she made clear her thinking had changed, saying that the "survival of America matters, and it's bigger than one person."
End of nest
Candidate header Hurd
Former Texas congressman Will Hurd launched his campaign in late June while declaring that if Republicans nominate "a lawless, selfish, failed politician like Donald Trump. . . we all know Joe Biden will win again." The ex-CIA officer was known in Congress for his willingness to work with Democrats and is now making a longshot pitch for his more moderate brand of what he calls "common-sense leadership."
Hurd left the House in 2021 after serving three terms in a battleground district. He broke with the majority of his party to vote against repealing the Affordable Care Act, support universal background checks for gun purchases and condemn Trump's comments that four minority congresswoman should "go back" to the places they came from.
End of nest
Candidate header Hutchinson
Asa Hutchinson, who spent eight years as governor of Arkansas, kicked off his presidential bid in April. He urged Republicans to look past Trump well before the midterms intensified some GOP doubts about the former president: In January, Hutchinson said the ex-president's role in the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the Capitol "disqualifies" him from another term. Hutchinson, a former U.S. attorney who also served in President George W. Bush's administration, made the stage for the first Republican debate but has yet to break out of the single digits in polling.
End of nest
Pence header
Mike Pence, who served as vice president under Trump, launched his presidential bid in June while suggesting his former running mate is unfit for office. Pence said that anyone who "puts themselves over the Constitution" or asks others to do so "should never be president of the United States again," sharpening his criticisms of Trump's failed efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
Pence broke with Trump when he refused to interfere with the certification of Biden's electoral win on Jan. 6, 2021, leading some in the pro-Trump mob outside the U.S. Capitol that day to chant, "Hang Mike Pence!" Still, he has indicated he will support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination. Pence has pitched himself as a "Christian, a conservative and a Republican — in that order." He has leaned into issues that other Republicans find politically uncomfortable, calling for changes to Medicare and Social Security and advocating abortion restrictions while highlighting the Trump administration's role in overturning Roe v. Wade .
End of nest
Ramaswamy header
Vivek Ramaswamy, a wealthy entrepreneur and author of "Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam," jumped into the presidential race as a little-known, first-time candidate. But he seized the spotlight at the first Republican debate, becoming a top target for rivals and positioning himself as a Trump-like political outsider with far-right views. He has centered his campaign on opposition to all things "woke," tapping into a common theme for conservatives who have criticized diversity programs and certain concepts of race and gender. Among Ramaswamy's proposals: ending affirmative action and raising the voting age to 25.
End of nest
Candidate header Scott
Tim Scott, the only Black U.S. senator in the GOP, has been highlighting his family's "cotton to Congress" story while also declaring that "America is not defined by our original sin." He's pitching himself as an unusually compelling messenger against the political left while also striking a more hopeful, positive tone.
Scott has significant financial resources for a campaign. He started with $22 million in cash from his Senate campaign account and millions more in a super PAC with extensive support from Oracle founder Larry Ellison, one of the world's richest people. And he pulled into third place in some Iowa polls amid a summer ad blitz. But he didn't have a breakthrough moment at the first GOP debate and is still struggling to distinguish himself.
End of nest
Candidate header Suarez
Miami Mayor Francis Suarez ended his long-shot 2024 presidential campaign less than three months after he launched it. He jumped into the presidential race in mid-June, becoming the only Hispanic candidate in the field and the third candidate from Florida. Suarez, 45, failed to qualify for the first Republican debate after falling short of the necessary polling requirements.
"While I have decided to suspend my campaign for President, my commitment to making this a better nation for every American remains," Suarez said in a post shared on X, formerly known as Twitter. During his campaign, he pitched himself as a centrist who represented "generational change" and could broaden the GOP's appeal.
end nest
Democrats CandidateHeader Biden
Biden is seeking reelection, saying he wants to "finish the job" he started when the country was besieged by a deadly pandemic, a reeling economy and a teetering democracy. Polling shows that many Democrats would prefer a nominee other than Biden in 2024, and at 80 he is the oldest president in U.S. history to seek a second term. But major Democratic leaders have not taken steps to challenge him, and his party's better-than-expected performance in the 2022 midterms helped quiet critics.
End of nest
Kennedy header
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a controversial member of the storied Kennedy family who is known for his anti-vaccine views, parlayed his famous last name into years of advocacy as an environmental lawyer and best-selling author. In recent years, however, he has become better-known as one of the country's most prominent opponents of vaccines and peddled false claims linking them to autism. He gained even more notoriety during the pandemic while spreading disinformation about coronavirus vaccines.
End of nest
Williamson header
Activist and self-help author Marianne Williamson is waging a long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination. Williamson is positioning herself to Biden's left, advocating tuition-free higher education at public institutions, among other initiatives. She also ran for president in 2020, calling for "a moral and spiritual awakening" in the United States, and dropped out shortly before the first nominating contests. "We need to offer fundamental economic reform. Nothing short of that will beat the Republicans in 2024," she told The Post in an interview.
End of nest
Potential Republican candidates Candidate header Youngkin
Glenn Youngkin quickly drew presidential buzz after winning the Virginia governor's race in 2021 and stumping for other Republicans in purple states during the 2022 midterms. Some donors remain intrigued by him as a 2024 contender, and Rupert Murdoch, the conservative media mogul, has urged Youngkin to jump in the race. But Youngkin has said he is focused on Virginia's 2023 elections and would face logistical hurdles jumping into the presidential contest late. Jeff Roe, a top adviser on Youngkin's 2021 campaign, now works for a super PAC supporting DeSantis's White House bid.

Full text: More than a dozen candidates are running for president in 2024, most of them on the Republican side. Top contenders for the GOP nomination include former president Donald Trump, who has pressed forward through two indictments, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is taking sharper aim at Trump since officially joining the race.
New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu wrote an op-ed explaining that he decided against running for president because he wants to focus on defeating Trump. President Biden has announced he is running again; two other Democratic candidates, both long shots, have also announced their campaigns.

Trump got an early start, announcing his third White House bid in mid-November from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla. Prominent Republicans appeared newly willing to criticize Trump after the midterms, with some openly blaming the former president for elevating flawed candidates. But Trump has solidified his status at the head of the pack in recent months, growing his lead in the polls.
Many Republicans have rallied to Trump's defense after state and federal indictments. In Florida, a federal grand jury indicted Trump on 37 counts over allegations that he obstructed justice in his mishandling of hundreds of classified documents that he retained after leaving the White House. And in New York, the former president has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records surrounding hush money payments to an adult-film actress. In speeches, Trump has repeated his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and cast the New York charges as the latest effort to thwart him. "For those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution," he declared at the Conservative Political Action Conference.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis filed paperwork for a presidential run in late-May, moving ahead with a long-expected campaign that many Republicans viewed as the most formidable primary challenge to Trump. DeSantis had became a GOP star as a first-term governor who derided pandemic-driven shutdowns and vaccine mandates and cast himself as an enemy of what he calls "woke ideology" in the news media, major companies such as Disney and schools, where he has worked to restrict discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity.
Fresh off a landslide reelection, DeSantis has continued to roll out policies that play well with the conservative base and raked in donations that would position him well for a run. But he's lost significant ground to Trump in recent polls as some supporters voice concerns about his strategy. He is pitching himself as a better bet than Trump to beat Biden in the swing states that will decide the election. At the same time, some Republicans worry he's gone too far to the right on issues such as abortion.

During his bid for governor, Elder opposed the minimum wage, called to let employers ask female applicants whether they plan to get pregnant, rejected the coronavirus vaccine mandate for state workers and endorsed Trump's false assertion that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent.
On his website for his presidential bid, Elder focuses on standard Republican issues including fighting crime, securing the border and addressing inflation.

Start of nest
Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who later served as Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, was the first prominent Republican to challenge Trump for the presidency. If she wins the GOP nomination, Haley would be the first woman and the first Asian American GOP presidential nominee. She has called for "a new generation of leadership" and highlighted her gender and her family's immigrant roots while rejecting "identity politics."
Haley has distanced herself from Trump at times, saying in 2021 that his post-election actions "will be judged harshly by history," but said later that year that she would not run if Trump did. In an interview early this year with Fox News, she made clear her thinking had changed, saying that the "survival of America matters, and it's bigger than one person."

Candidate header Hutchinson
Start of nest
Asa Hutchinson, who spent eight years as governor of Arkansas, kicked off his presidential bid in April. He urged Republicans to look past Trump well before the midterms intensified some GOP doubts about the former president: In January, Hutchinson said the ex-president's role in the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the Capitol "disqualifies" him from another term. Hutchinson, a former U.S. attorney who also served in President George W. Bush's administration, is one of many lesser-known 2024 hopefuls traveling extensively to early-nominating states and hoping to break through.

Pence header
Start of nest
Mike Pence, who served as vice president under Trump, launched his presidential bid in June while suggesting his former running mate is unfit for office. Pence said that anyone who "puts themselves over the Constitution" or asks others to do so "should never be president of the United States again," sharpening his criticisms of Trump's failed efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
Pence broke with Trump when he refused to interfere with the certification of Biden's electoral win on Jan. 6, 2021, leading some in the pro-Trump mob outside the U.S. Capitol that day to chant, "Hang Mike Pence!" Still, Pence has often been selective about the times and places he criticizes Trump sharply and has said he will "absolutely support" whoever wins the GOP nomination. (He says he doesn't think Trump will be the nominee.)
Pence jumped in the 2024 race after many months of traveling to key primary states and pitching himself as a "Christian, a conservative and a Republican — in that order." He has leaned into issues that other Republicans find politically uncomfortable, calling for changes to Medicare and Social Security and advocating abortion restrictions while highlighting the Trump administration's role in overturning Roe v. Wade .

Ramaswamy header
Start of nest
Vivek Ramaswamy, a wealthy entrepreneur and author of "Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam," became the third declared Republican contender for president in February. The long-shot candidate is centering his campaign on opposition to all things "woke," tapping into a common theme for conservatives who have criticized diversity programs and certain concepts of race and gender. Among Ramaswamy's proposals: ending affirmative action and raising the voting age to 25.

Candidate header Scott
Start of nest
Tim Scott, the only Black U.S. senator in the GOP, joined the presidential race officially in May and his team announced a $6 million advertising buy they say will run through the first GOP debate. The South Carolinian has highlighted his family's "cotton to Congress" story while also declaring that "America is not defined by our original sin," pitching himself as an unusually compelling messenger against the political left while also striking a more hopeful, positive tone.
While Scott has yet to break through in national polling, he has significant financial resources for a campaign. He started with $22 million in cash from his Senate campaign account and millions more in a super PAC with extensive support from Oracle founder Larry Ellison, one of the world's richest people.

Candidate header Suarez
Start of nest
Francis X. Suarez, the Republican mayor of Miami, jumped into the presidential race in mid-June, becoming the only Hispanic candidate in the field and the third candidate from Florida. Suarez, 45, is pitching himself as a centrist who represents "generational change" and can broaden the GOP's appeal. He said on "Good Morning America" that he's running because he has a "different message" from the rest of the field and believes voters are eager for "someone who can unify them."
Suarez was first elected mayor of Miami in 2017 and is the son of the city's first Cuban American mayor, Xavier Suarez. He voted for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis's Democratic opponent in 2018 and has accused the governor of carrying out a "personal vendetta" against the Walt Disney Co. that cost the state jobs. Complicating his campaign: Suarez is under investigation by the FBI and the Securities and Exchange Commission for $10,000 monthly payments he received from a South Florida developer for consulting services. Suarez has denied using his office to help secure permits for a $70 million development.

Former Texas congressman Will Hurd launched his campaign in late June while declaring that if Republicans nominate "a lawless, selfish, failed politician like Donald Trump. . . we all know Joe Biden will win again." The ex-CIA officer was known in Congress for his willingness to work with Democrats and is now making a longshot pitch for his more moderate brand of what he calls "common-sense leadership."
Hurd left the House in 2021 after serving three terms in a battleground district. He broke with the majority of his party to vote against repealing the Affordable Care Act, support universal background checks for gun purchases and condemn Trump's comments that four minority congresswoman should "go back" to the places they came from.

Democrats CandidateHeader Biden
Start of nest
Biden is seeking reelection, saying he wants to "finish the job" he started when the country was besieged by a deadly pandemic, a reeling economy and a teetering democracy. Polling shows that many Democrats would prefer a nominee other than Biden in 2024, and at 80 he is the oldest president in U.S. history to seek a second term. But major Democratic leaders have not taken steps to challenge him, and his party's better-than-expected performance in the 2022 midterms helped quiet critics.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a controversial member of the storied Kennedy family who is known for his anti-vaccine views, has filed to run for president. Kennedy, 69, parlayed his famous last name into years of advocacy as an environmental lawyer and best-selling author. In recent years, however, he has become better-known as one of the country's most prominent opponents of vaccines and peddled false claims linking them to autism. He gained even more notoriety during the pandemic while spreading disinformation about coronavirus vaccines.

Activist and self-help author Marianne Williamson is waging a long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination. Williamson is positioning herself to Biden's left, advocating tuition-free higher education at public institutions, among other initiatives. She also ran for president in 2020, calling for "a moral and spiritual awakening" in the United States, and dropped out shortly before the first nominating contests. "We need to offer fundamental economic reform. Nothing short of that will beat the Republicans in 2024," she told The Post in an interview.

Potential Republican candidates Candidate header Cheney
Start of nest
Former Wyoming congresswoman Liz Cheney has waged a long, lonely battle to steer her party away from Trump, persistently criticizing the former president and warning of the damage she says he is doing not just to the GOP but also to democracy. For such efforts, Cheney was ousted in 2021 from her position as House conference chair and replaced with Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), a staunch Trump defender. Cheney would go on to serve as one of two Republicans on the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection.
Last year, Cheney lost her primary race in Wyoming to Harriet M. Hageman, an election denier, by a historic margin. Cheney has vowed to do whatever it takes to prevent Trump from reaching the White House again and has not ruled out running for president herself.

Kristi L. Noem, the Republican governor of South Dakota, won reelection to her second term in November and has gained attention within conservative circles for shrugging off restrictions and mandates in her state during the pandemic. She has claimed the state got through the pandemic "better than virtually every other state," though South Dakota in 2020 had among the highest coronavirus infections and death tolls per capita.
Her team has been watching potential rivals on the national stage, with one adviser contrasting her with DeSantis late last year and a spokesman openly criticizing the Florida governor's record on abortion. But it's not clear Noem will take the plunge for 2024. Asked about a potential run during a February visit to Washington, D.C., she didn't rule it out but also didn't say she's interested.

Glenn Youngkin quickly drew presidential buzz after winning the Virginia governor's race in 2021 and stumping for other Republicans in purple states during the 2022 midterms. He has repeatedly said he is "humbled" by speculation he could run for president and has not publicly ruled it out. But he has also said recently that he is focused on Virginia's upcoming elections. Jeff Roe, a top political adviser to Youngkin, recently joined a super PAC supporting DeSantis for 2024, raising further doubts about Youngkin's interest in a national campaign. But Youngkin recently fed 2024 presidential buzz with a video ad linking him to Ronald Reagan.

Full text: Amazon is winding down its charitable-giving arm next month on grounds that its impact is "often spread too thin," even though it has donated to more than a million organizations over the past decade.
In a note to customers Wednesday, Amazon said the program "AmazonSmile," which was launched in 2013, would be suspended on Feb. 20. Drawing on the company's own funds, AmazonSmile directed donations equaling a half-percent from each purchase to a charity of the customer's choice.
To help ease the transition, participating charities will receive a one-time donation equaling roughly a quarter of what they received in 2022, the company said.
Since its launch, "the program has not grown to create the impact that we had originally hoped," the company said, adding that it will still "pursue and invest in other areas where we've seen we can make meaningful change" such as affordable housing, education and food-assistance programs.
The program's closure comes after the e-commerce giant announced plans to cut 18,000 jobs and as numerous other technology companies are laying off workers amid global economic uncertainty. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
Over the years, the program distributed hundreds of millions of dollars to nonprofit organizations , including St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, the American Cancer Society, and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The ASPCA said in February that it had raised $10 million through Amazon's program.
But AmazonSmile also distributed more than $42,000 to nonprofit entities spreading disinformation about coronavirus vaccines, The Post has reported.
The program's donations increased steadily between 2013 and 2020, according to tax records. In 2013, the charitable-giving arm disbursed $10,000. In 2020, its distributions grew to $60.5 million, which went to more than 300,000 groups.
Most nonprofits were allowed to participate in AmazonSmile, except those on a list of hate groups from the Southern Poverty Law Center, as well as those on a list of groups suspected of ties to terrorism compiled by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control.
Yet only four groups — the ASPCA, St. Jude's, the Nature Conservancy and the American Red Cross — received more than $1 million. Only 24 secured more than $100,000, while about 230 got more than $10,000. Thousands of churches, neighborhood associations, animal shelters and little leagues received just $5.
In a statement to The Post, an Amazon spokesman also pointed to a disparity in distributions. He said that while the company has donated $449 million to charities worldwide, the average donation to U.S. charities in 2021 was less than $230. He reiterated that the program was not as effective as the company had hoped and Amazon would continue other philanthropic efforts.
Matt Bershadker, the ASPCA's president and CEO, said in a statement that the nonprofit appreciated AmazonSmile's support over the years. "We are sad to see the AmazonSmile program end, given the enormous boost it provided a wide range of vital nonprofits, including the ASPCA," he said.
An American Cancer Society spokeswoman said AmazonSmile's donations were appreciated and contributed to important work, and it's "always disappointing to hear about any charitable giving programs being discontinued."

Full text: Health Officials Watching Xbb.1.5
Booster push competeswith misinformation Three years after the novel coronavirus emerged, a new variant, XBB.1.5, is quickly becoming the dominant strain in parts of the United States because of a potent mix of mutations that makes it easier to spread broadly, including among those who have been previously infected or vaccinated.
XBB.1.5, pegged by the World Health Organization as "the most transmissible" descendant yet of the omicron variant, rose from barely 2 percent of U.S. cases at the start of December to more than 27 percent the first week of January, according to estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
More than 70 percent of cases in the Northeast are thought to be XBB.1.5.
While there is no evidence so far that XBB.1.5 is more virulent than its predecessors, a recent swirl of misinformation linking the rise of new variants to vaccination has cast a spotlight on this latest strain and raised concern among some health experts that it could further limit booster uptake.
"XBB did not evolve because people were vaccinated," said Vaughn Cooper, a professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Pittsburgh. "The way it evolved, let's be straight, is because people were infected by multiple viruses at the same time."
Since the omicron variant ignited an explosion of cases last winter, it spawned a host of descendants that are even more adept at slipping past antibodies and caused most infections in the United States. The XBB line emerged as a result of two other omicron subvariants swapping parts.
Virologists who studied XBB.1.5 say it does not appear better at escaping antibodies than other immune-evading predecessors, but it is better at binding to the cell and replicating. That means it can more easily become the dominant strain in a community than its relatives, but it doesn't necessarily worsen an individual's covid symptoms.
Health officials are urging Americans to get a booster dose of the new coronavirus vaccine formulated for omicron subvariants to protect against an expected winter surge in cases from holiday gatherings and as people continue to congregate indoors.
The nation is averaging nearly 48,000 people hospitalized with covid-19 over a seven-day period, the highest since late February but far below the 150,000 peak set about a year ago. The average daily count of hospitalized patients is up by about 20,000 since Thanksgiving.
But only 15 percent of those eligible - and 38 percent of seniors, who are most at risk - have received the updated shots.
"For folks without a very recent infection or a bivalent vaccine, you likely have very little protection against infection. And for older folks, diminishing protection against serious illness," Ashish Jha, coordinator of the White House's covid-19 response, tweeted Jan. 4. "So am I concerned about XBB.1.5? Yes. Am I worried this represents some huge set back? No."
XBB prompted some concerns because of lab studies showing antibodies generated by vaccines struggle to block that variant. But that doesn't mean the vaccines don't work: For much of the last year, waves of infections from immune-evading variants have not caused surges of severe illness at hospitals, and experts think that widespread immunity from shots and prior infections are making people more resilient.
While antibodies do not provide absolute shields against reinfections, they still reduce the odds of contracting the virus and greatly reduce the likelihood of severe illness and hospitalization.
"Things like boosters are always beneficial," said Kristian Andersen, a professor in the department of immunology and microbiology who tracks coronavirus variants at the Scripps Research Institute. "Even if you get infected, you are expected to have less viral load, and you are expected to be able to transmit the virus less."
But the focus on boosters is also drawing criticism. An opinion piece published in the Wall Street Journal by a member of its editorial board suggested that repeated vaccination made Americans more susceptible to new variants.
Paul Offit, director of the vaccine education center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the risk of mild breakthrough infection has been consistent throughout the pandemic despite the virus's evolution, so there is no reason to blame shots for the variants. But he said it's difficult to justify regular booster shots for the general population when the protection against mild illness is brief and immunity from earlier shots or infections still provides robust protection against severe outcomes.
"At some level, we are going to have to get used to mild illness unless you want to take three doses a year and stay in your house most of the time," said Offit, who also advises the Food and Drug Administration on vaccines.
FDA Commissioner Robert Califf, in tweets he said he wrote to address prevalent "misinformation/disinformation," noted that there was no clear evidence to support the thesis of the Wall Street Journal piece.
"Raising doubts about the value of vaccines will continue to lead well-intended people to delay getting an updated vaccine, leading to a clearly documented risk of death or severe illness," Califf tweeted, after many people - including Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Richard Urso, an ophthalmologist and member of America's Frontline Doctors, a group that spreads covid misinformation - cited the Wall Street Journal piece as they questioned the use of coronavirus vaccines.
Several studies have tried to examine whether SARS-CoV-2 variants spread faster in locations with higher vaccination rates and found no evidence to support it, said Jesse Bloom, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle.
"XBB.1.5 is just sort of the latest variant in what is going to be a continual process of the virus evolving," Bloom said. "There's a lot of space for the virus to get mutations."
While XBB.1.5's mutations have sparked scientific intrigue, experts caution it doesn't substantially change circumstances for ordinary people navigating pandemic life with omicron's descendants as the dominant strains since last spring. In addition to staying up to date on boosters, don't assume you can't get sick again if your last shot or bout with covid was more than several months ago. Wear high-quality masks and avoid crowds to prevent infections that can still cause mild illness, disrupt plans and lead to long-term health complications.
The World Health Organization is monitoring XBB.1.5 because of how quickly it has supplanted other subvariants - and each wave of mass infection brings opportunities for the virus to morph into something more dangerous.
"The more this virus circulates, the more opportunities it will have to change," Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead on covid-19, said at a news conference Wednesday. "We do expect further waves of infection around the world but that doesn't have to translate into further waves of death because our countermeasures continue to work."
XBB.1.5 surged first in the Northeast, where it now makes up nearly three-quarters of cases. But hospitals there have not raised alarms about people coming in sicker because of the new subvariant.
Official case counts are no longer considered reliable because at-home test results are not reported, but wastewater tracking and other measures suggest cases are rising across the country.
At Northwell Health, New York's largest hospital chain, the ranks of patients testing positive rapidly increased after Thanksgiving, along with the share of viruses confirmed to be the XBB.1.5 strain in lab testing. The "vast majority" of patients with coronavirus are admitted for other causes or coronavirus is a complicating factor, said Bruce Farber, Northwell's chief of infectious diseases. The share of those patients who received intensive care or were placed on ventilators remained stable after the rise of XBB.1.5 in early December. "In terms of very sick people with covid, it's almost exclusively elderly and people with a lot of morbidities or who are immunosuppressed," he said.
Experts hope hospitals in other parts of the country can share Northwell's experience: weathering a rise in cases without covid wards packed with people fighting for their lives.
"Even though this thing is continuing to evolve, if you take a step back and look at the big peaks, they are not as ferocious as let's say delta in the last half of 2021 or the early BA.1 omicron wave," said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. "Robust population immunity helps communities withstand new variants."

Since the omicron variant ignited an explosion of cases last winter, it spawned a host of descendants that are even more adept at slipping past antibodies and caused most infections in the United States. The XBB line emerged as a result of two other omicron subvariants swapping parts.
Virologists who studied XBB.1.5 say it does not appear better at escaping antibodies than other immune-evading predecessors, but it is better at binding to the cell and replicating. That means it can more easily become the dominant strain in a community than its relatives, but it doesn't necessarily worsen an individual's covid symptoms.
Health officials are urging Americans to get a booster dose of the new coronavirus vaccine formulated for omicron subvariants to protect against an expected winter surge in cases from holiday gatherings and as people continue to congregate indoors.
The nation is averaging nearly 48,000 people hospitalized with covid-19 over a seven-day period, the highest since late February but far below the 150,000 peak set about a year ago. The average daily count of hospitalized patients is up by about 20,000 since Thanksgiving.
But only 15 percent of those eligible — and 38 percent of senior citizens, who are most at risk — have received the updated shots.
"For folks without a very recent infection or a bivalent vaccine, you likely have very little protection against infection. And for older folks, diminishing protection against serious illness," Ashish Jha, coordinator of the White House's covid-19 response, tweeted Jan. 4. "So am I concerned about XBB.1.5? Yes. Am I worried this represents some huge setback? No."
XBB prompted some concerns because of lab studies showing antibodies generated by vaccines struggle to block that variant. But that doesn't mean the vaccines don't work: For much of the past year, waves of infections from immune-evading variants have not caused surges of severe illness at hospitals, and experts believe that widespread immunity from shots and prior infections are making people more resilient to the virus.
While antibodies do not provide foolproof shields against reinfections, they still reduce the odds of contracting the virus and greatly reduce the likelihood of severe illness and hospitalization.
"Things like boosters are always beneficial," said Kristian Andersen, a professor in the department of immunology and microbiology who tracks coronavirus variants at the Scripps Research Institute. "Even if you get infected, you are expected to have less viral load, and you are expected to be able to transmit the virus less."
But the focus on boosters is also drawing criticism. An opinion piece published in the Wall Street Journal by a member of its editorial board suggested that repeated vaccination made Americans more susceptible to new variants.
Paul Offit, director of the vaccine education center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the risk of mild breakthrough infection has been consistent throughout the pandemic despite the virus's evolution, so there is no reason to blame shots for the variants. But he said it's difficult to justify regular booster shots for the general population when the protection against mild illness is brief and immunity from earlier shots or infections still provides robust protection against severe outcomes.
"At some level, we are going to have to get used to mild illness unless you want to take three doses a year and stay in your house most of the time," said Offit, who also advises the Food and Drug Administration on vaccines.
FDA commissioner Robert Califf, in a series of tweets he said he wrote to address prevalent "misinformation/disinformation," noted that there was no clear evidence to support the thesis of the Wall Street Journal piece.
"Raising doubts about the value of vaccines will continue to lead well-intended people to delay getting an updated vaccine, leading to a clearly documented risk of death or severe illness," Califf tweeted, after Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.); Richard Urso, an ophthalmologist and member of America's Frontline Doctors, a group that spreads covid misinformation; and many others cited the Wall Street Journal piece as they questioned the use of coronavirus vaccines.
Several studies have tried to examine whether SARS-CoV-2 variants spread faster in locations with higher vaccination rates and found no evidence to support it, said Jesse Bloom, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle.
"XBB.1.5 is just sort of the latest variant in what is going to be a continual process of the virus evolving," Bloom said. "There's a lot of space for the virus to get mutations."
While XBB.1.5's mutations have sparked scientific intrigue, experts caution it doesn't substantially change circumstances for ordinary people navigating pandemic life with omicron's descendants as the dominant strains since last spring. In addition to staying up to date on boosters, don't assume you can't get sick again if your last shot or bout with covid was more than several months ago. Wear high-quality masks and avoid crowds to avoid infections that can still cause mild illness, disrupt plans and lead to long-term health complications.
The World Health Organization is monitoring XBB.1.5 because of how quickly it has supplanted other subvariants — and each wave of mass infection brings opportunities for the virus to morph into something more dangerous.
"The more this virus circulates, the more opportunities it will have to change," said Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead on covid-19, at a Wednesday news conference. "We do expect further waves of infection around the world but that doesn't have to translate into further waves of death because our countermeasures continue to work."
XBB.1.5 surged first in the Northeast, where it now makes up nearly three quarters of cases. But hospitals there have not raised alarms about people coming in sicker because of the new subvariant.
Official case counts are no longer considered reliable because at-home test results are not reported, but wastewater tracking and other measures suggest cases are rising across the country.
At Northwell Health, New York's largest hospital chain, the ranks of patients testing positive rapidly increased after Thanksgiving, along with the share of viruses confirmed to be the XBB.1.5 strain in lab testing. The "vast majority" of patients with coronavirus are admitted for other causes or coronavirus is a complicating factor, Northwell's chief of infectious diseases Bruce Farber said. The share of those patients who received intensive care or were placed on ventilators remained stable after the rise of XBB.1.5 in early December. "In terms of very sick people with covid, it's almost exclusively elderly and people with a lot of morbidities or who are immunosuppressed," he said.
Experts hope hospitals in other parts of the country can share Northwell's experience: weathering a rise of cases without covid wards packed with people fighting for their lives.
"Even though this thing is continuing to evolve, if you take a step back and look at the big peaks, they are not as ferocious as let's say delta in the last half of 2021 or the early BA.1 omicron wave," said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. "Robust population immunity helps communities withstand new variants."

Full text: The news clip showed a towering blaze in a residential neighborhood in Germany, followed by a weeping homeowner giving an interview from the rubble of her burned-down house. A chyron at the bottom of the screen explained that Ukrainian refugees had set the fire, accidentally ravaging the home of their German hosts.
The video, which bore the logo of the German tabloid Bild, spread from a small YouTube account through the messaging app Telegram to Russian state media, until it could be found on nearly every major social platform, a forensic analysis later showed.
But it was a fake, with footage from unrelated events stitched together to form a bogus news report that cast Ukrainian refugees as feckless instigators wreaking havoc on the generous Germans who had taken them in.
As Russian forces continue to shell Ukrainian cities, pro-Kremlin propagandists have homed in on a new target: turning Europeans against the 7.8 million Ukrainian refugees who make up the continent's largest displacement since World War II. In doing so, Russia's disinformation merchants are needling at deep-seated European fault lines over immigration, echoing how Russia-linked operatives famously exploited major U.S. social media platforms to sow division around topics such as race ahead of the 2016 presidential election.
Experts say the propaganda campaign, which Facebook parent company Meta has called "the largest and most complex Russian-origin operation that we've disrupted since the beginning of the war in Ukraine," aims to stoke fear and divisions among Ukraine's critical European allies as they brace for a new influx of refugees this winter. And while Europeans remain overwhelmingly supportive of fleeing Ukrainians, there are fears that Russian efforts to weaponize the issue may be finding their mark.
In Germany - home to more than 1 million Ukrainians - attempted arson attacks and threatening graffiti on refugee accommodations and schools in recent months suggest the messaging is already reaching a radicalized fringe. In many cases, it's spreading via the fast-growing messaging app Telegram, which does far less content moderation than established giants such as Meta's Facebook and Google's YouTube.
One morning in October, at a local hotel that was converted into a refugee center run by the Red Cross in Gross Strömkendorf, a village on Germany's north coast, someone used spray paint to turn the Red Cross sign into the shape of a bright red swastika. Two days after the swastika attack, the hotel was burned down - not by its Ukrainian inhabitants, but by a German serial arsonist, authorities say. They say they don't believe the fire was politically motivated. All 14 refugees escaped unharmed.
Russian disinformation "is a long-term investment, and it could become very, very toxic," Huberta von Voss, executive director of the Germany office for the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based nonprofit that studies extremism and disinformation, said of the Russian efforts. "That can do real-world harm."
While Europeans are still overwhelmingly in favor of welcoming refugees, support is slipping in key countries. A poll by the Bertelsmann Foundation found that the proportion of Germans who believe the country should take in refugees from Ukraine fell from 86 percent in March, near the beginning of the war, to 74 percent in September.
"Lies about Ukrainian refugees and efforts to capitalize on Europeans' fears have not successfully polarized or shaped the public discourse so far," according to a recent European Parliament-supported study by the Brussels-based European Policy Center. But the proportion of information that is hostile toward Ukrainian refugees "is increasing and generating greater engagement on social media," it warned.
Russian disinformation narratives have also seeped into mainstream politics. In September, Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany's opposition Christian Democrats, accused Ukrainian refugees of "social tourism" - taking advantage of Germany's welfare system while traveling back and forth to Ukraine, a narrative frequently touted by pro-Kremlin accounts. He later apologized.
And there are indications that anti-refugee propaganda may be finding its mark among an already radicalized fringe taking to the streets for weekly demonstrations against energy prices.
In one incident in the eastern city of Leipzig in October, marchers faced off against a group of Ukrainian refugees demonstrating against Russia's bombardment. One protester called the group of Ukrainians "pigs," adding, "You are living on our dime," as others chanted, "Nazis out." (Equating Ukrainians with Nazis has been a dominant theme of Russian propaganda since President Vladimir Putin sought to justify the invasion as a campaign to "de-Nazify" the country.)
Kateryna Pikalova, a 26-year-old from the Ukrainian city of Dnipro who helped organize the Ukrainian demonstration, described the scene as "chaos" but said she was not surprised. She recalled a recent incident when she and her mother, who recently arrived as a refugee, were approached by a man on the street who began comparing Ukrainians to Nazis, referring to images he'd seen online.
"You hear this on the street, and you understand that this Russian psychological operation is in action," Pikalova said. "This Russian big machine is unstoppable, it's everywhere. You can see it on the internet, you can feel it on the streets."
Disinformation fault lines The demonization of Ukrainian refugees in Germany via social media hoaxes and bogus news stories represents a characteristically insidious strand of disinformation, experts say, from Russian propagandists, who have long shown a knack for tapping into other countries' domestic political divisions to advance their aims.
Europe's largest economy has been central to Moscow's informational warfare since the Cold War, when the country was the dividing line between east and west. That is still a fault line Russian propaganda attempts to exploit, while in recent years Kremlin information operations have also focused on stirring the backlash against Germany's decision to allow in more than a million largely Middle Eastern refugees.
And Germany is a country where Russian channels have reach. Before it was shut down by German authorities in March, RT DE, the German-language arm of Russian state television channel Russia Today, was the most interacted-with German-language media outlet on Facebook, and the third on Twitter, according to a study last year by the German Marshall Fund.
The anti-refugee narrative began as the first fleeing Ukrainians crossed the border, but it took off in the spring and summer, after early attempts to justify Russia's February invasion or play it down as a "special military operation" did not persuade Western audiences.
Whereas past waves of disinformation targeting Middle Eastern refugees portrayed them as a "cultural" threat to Europeans, the campaign against Ukrainian refugees presents them as a threat to Europeans' health and wealth, the European Policy Center found.
A growing body of research makes clear that the anti-refugee messaging has been fueled by a sprawling, coordinated, Russia-based network of fake news websites, Telegram channels, YouTube and Instagram channels, and even Change.org petitions. And it's being systematically amplified by armies of fake social media accounts, real pro-Kremlin influencers and Russian state media accounts across virtually every major social platform.
Exactly who in Russia is behind it is not yet clear, and researchers have yet to find direct links to the Kremlin. But whoever it is appears to be well-resourced, experienced in disinformation campaigns and very persistent. In a September report on the network, Facebook parent Meta said the campaign relied on "an unusual combination of sophistication and brute force."
New research by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, shared with The Washington Post ahead of its publication, provides the most detailed insight yet into the disinformation campaign, highlighting its focus on Ukrainian refugees and tracing how the campaign worked to push specific narratives to European audiences.
The ISD report focuses on a specific Telegram channel with about 10,000 followers, called Deutsche Wahrheit ("German Truth"), as a microcosm of the broader campaign. Though the channel's name and posts were in German, researchers noticed that the file names of the videos and clips it uploaded were often in Russian. Those files also included folder names and project names that matched those found on videos posted by accounts previously identified as part of a pro-Kremlin propaganda network.
Out of 219 videos posted in Deutsche Wahrheit between April 15 and July 11, 40 percent mentioned refugees, according to the ISD study. Other videos sought to link Ukraine more generally to Nazism, discredit specific Ukrainian leaders or blame Europe's energy woes and inflation on its support of Ukraine.
The posts, many of which featured faked or doctored videos made to look like mainstream media reports, implicated Ukrainian refugees in everything from plotting terrorist attacks to bringing monkeypox to Germany.
The faked clip that appeared to show Ukrainian refugees burning down their German hosts' house in Wulfen was one of those. Its spread offers a case study in how the campaign used small, obscure accounts to seed and perhaps focus-group falsehoods that it could then spread to wider audiences, staying a step ahead of the big platforms' content moderators.
On May 14, someone created a German-language YouTube channel with a name that translates to "News and Rumors," according to ISD's forensic analysis, and uploaded the faked Bild news clip. It received a paltry 12 likes and was later deleted. YouTube didn't respond to requests for comment.
That same day, however, the video was uploaded to the Deutsche Wahrheit Telegram channel, which appears to have served as an early or original source for numerous videos in the campaign. Posting on Twitter on May 17, Bild's head of Digital, Timo Lokoschat, denounced the report as a "complete fake" - but that didn't stop its spread. Bild didn't respond to requests for comment.
By the next day, the video was making the rounds of large Russian-language Telegram channels, some with hundreds of thousands of subscribers. On May 19, it made headlines across Russian media, including Sputnik and the news agency RIA FAN. It also spread to Chinese social media site Weibo, where it was viewed hundreds of thousands of times.
Though the video was eventually debunked, few of the stories were ever corrected or retracted. And links to the articles and videos continued circulating on Telegram, Twitter and Facebook, where fake accounts with AI-generated profile images systematically amplified them.
The German public television network, ZDF, first tied a spate of such faked news videos, which purported to be from German outlets such as Bild, Die Welt and Der Spiegel, to a coordinated disinformation campaign in August. ZDF noted that some of the fake videos were being promoted in Facebook advertisements.
That triggered Meta's investigation, which identified dozens more fake news sites and examples of disinformation targeting European audiences, primarily in Germany, and attributed the campaign to Russian origins. Meta took down all the ones it could find. While Deutsche Wahrheit's Instagram account survived those sweeps, Meta spokeswoman Margarita Franklin confirmed that it was part of the same campaign, and Instagram suspended it in November following The Post's inquiries.
Such investigations have become part of Facebook's business, and to a lesser extent those of Twitter and YouTube, since they first identified evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.
But as content moderation has increased on the major U.S.-based social platforms, propagandists and extremists have found new outlets.
Those include Telegram, the stateless messaging app that has become a leading communications channel in much of Eastern Europe, including Russia and Ukraine.
Similar anti-refugee disinformation campaigns linked to "hacktivism" groups in Russia and neighboring Belarus have been targeting Polish audiences, said Givi Gigitashvili, a Poland-based research associate for the nonprofit Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab.
Telegram spokesperson Remi Vaughn defended the company's role in the information ecosystem. Vaughn did not dispute that Telegram takes a laissez-faire attitude to channels that spread misinformation but said it is working to expand a fact-checking initiative. "It is our belief that the most powerful tool against misinformation is the spread of verified information," Vaughn said.
Only about 2 million Germans subscribe to Telegram channels, Vaughn added, making it "unlikely Telegram channels could play any noticeable role in Germany's information landscape, let alone be used as a tool for disinformation of any relevance."
But German authorities warned that the messaging app has become a "medium for radicalization," and in October a court fined the company $5 million for failing to comply with German law regarding the reporting of illegal content.
A string of incidents in recent years - including a plot to kidnap the health minister - has stoked fears that online extremism fueled by misinformation and conspiracy theories is increasingly manifesting into offline violence.
Earlier this month, German authorities arrested 25 members of what they described as a "terrorist group" suspected of plotting to storm parliament and overthrow the state by force. Prosecutors said members followed a mix of conspiracy theories and accuse its ringleader of reaching out to Russian officials during his attempts to bring about a new order in Germany.
'The discontent of the people' Pinpointing the role of Russian propaganda amid domestic extremism can be tricky, because foreign and domestic actors often work in concert, said Pia Lamberty, co-CEO of CeMAS, a German think tank that tracks online conspiracy theories and extremism. "There's a certain atmosphere created online, and this gives people the idea that they need to do something about it" - sometimes in the form of real-world hate crimes.
During the summer, graffiti in poorly spelled English reading "kill Ukrain kids" was sprayed on a school that teaches refugees in the eastern German city of Leipzig, while another kindergarten in the city attended by Ukrainians was targeted in an attempted arson. In October, a planned home for non-Ukrainian refugees was set fire to in Bautzen, Saxony.
Bild branded the hamlet of Gross Strömkendorf, situated on a picturesque inlet of the Baltic Sea, where the Red Cross refugee center was defaced and then burned to the ground, the "village of shame" in a column.
So far, attacks on refugee centers have risen only slightly amid the strain of more than a million new arrivals. There were 65 in Germany through October of this year, according to official figures cited by the German media, compared with 70 all last year, before the Ukrainian wave began. That compares with a peak of around 1,000 in 2015, as more than a million largely Middle Eastern refugees arrived in the country.
But there has been an increasingly "bad vibe" toward refugees in recent months, said Ulrike Seemann-Katz, the head of the refugee council for Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the state where the burned-down refugee center was located.
And as winter sets in, officials have said they expect an uptick in arrivals from the front lines in Ukraine, as Russian shelling inflicts severe damage to Ukrainian infrastructure - just as the impact of the energy crisis could be felt most strongly in Germany. Seeman-Katz said her organization has had an influx of emails asking it to give aid to Germans instead of refugees.
"Sometimes it doesn't even have to be insults - often they just make statements based on Russian propaganda," she said.
Anti-refugee sentiment has been fueled by weekly street demonstrations around Germany, said Seeman-Katz. Regular demonstrations against coronavirus vaccines and lockdown mandates have morphed into protests over the war and high energy prices, and anti-refugee sentiment has also bubbled up.
On a Monday in late October, in Germany's northern city of Schwerin, hundreds of demonstrators gathered at the steps of the city's 19th-century museum next to a banner asking, "Do you want to starve or freeze?"
Attendees carried Russian and German flags, and a speaker read a supposed "testimony" from a worker in the energy industry warning of a collapse in the grid. "You may have read it already in the channels," he began, referring to Telegram. The crowd swelled to several thousand as night fell.
A 64-year-old retiree wearing a string of fairy lights around her felt hat said she sees Ukrainian refugee children with new bicycles. "There are German children who can't afford that," she said. "Why does a refugee have to ride a bike? A refugee can walk."
She complained that state support meant refugees could leave windows open while having the heat on, while pensioners struggled to pay their bills. The woman spoke on the condition of anonymity because she feared potential repercussions, and like others at the demonstration expressed a distrust of the "mainstream media."
The retiree, who said she went to Telegram for her news, had heard about the fire at the refugee center in Gross Strömkendorf about 25 miles north, which at the time was assumed to be a targeted attack. "The fire is not okay," said the woman, "but the discontent of the people you can understand."
Morris also reported from Schwerin and Berlin. Oremus reported from Newark, Del. Vanessa Guinan-Bank in Berlin and Gross Strömkendorf contributed to this report.

Full text: It's time for our roundup of the biggest Pinocchios of the year.
False claims made by President Biden and conspiracy theories about the president dominate the list, which has no particular order. Misleading claims about the coronavirus, by a Republican and a Democrat, also made the cut. Former president Donald Trump earned this dubious honor for the eighth straight year by spreading a baseless conspiracy theory about one of his supporters at the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who also appeared on last year's Biggest Pinocchio list, earned two spots this year, and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) appears in the tally for the second straight year with a coronavirus claim.
" It seems like yesterday the first time I got arrested "
- President Biden, Jan. 11
For some unknown reason, President Biden likes to claim he was once arrested. During a speech in Atlanta this year, he did it again - referring to an unverified tale that as a teenager he was arrested for standing on the porch with a Black couple. They supposedly were the target of demonstrations because they bought a home in a White neighborhood near his house. We dug deep into the records and found too many contradictions in Biden's story, including the fact he lived far from the home in question. Biden landed on the Biggest Pinocchio list in 2020 with a similar false claim - that he had been arrested while trying to meet Nelson Mandela.
" If you wanted to kill a bunch of MAGA voters in the middle of the heartland, how better than [for Biden] to target them and their kids with this deadly fentanyl? "
- J.D. Vance, April 29
Sen.-elect J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) made a startlingly false claim shortly after he won the GOP nomination - that Biden was intentionally allowing drugs such as fentanyl to flood the United States with the goal of killing Trump supporters in the "heartland" of the country. But this hyperbolic claim was based on zero facts. Seizures of fentanyl have increased, not fallen, under Biden. Overdose deaths jumped sharply under Trump. As for Trump voters being supposedly targeted, opioids are killing people of color (most of whom, presumably, are not Trump voters) at higher rates than Whites.
Biden is "urging children to report their parents to federal authorities if their parents post something called covid disinformation "
- Tucker Carlson, Aug. 29
Fox News host Tucker Carlson claimed on his show that the Department of Homeland Security was urging children to report their parents if they post covid misinformation on social media. Blake Masters, then a GOP Senate candidate in Arizona, chimed in: "This is Chinese Communist Party stuff." It turns out that this tale stemmed from a rather benign video posted in 2021 aimed at adults about how to evaluate coronavirus claims spread on social media. But it was twisted into something much more sinister through a game of telephone tag in the right-leaning media - before emerging as a ridiculous conspiracy theory on Carlson's show.
" An attorney general who goes after parents and calls them terrorists if they want to go to a school board meeting "
- Kevin McCarthy, April 17
Over and over, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) asserted that Attorney General Merrick Garland called parents "terrorists" because they wanted to attend school board meetings. But McCarthy was relying on a Rube Goldberg artifice to put words in Garland's mouth. (Garland had received a letter from a school association, later withdrawn, that had said threats of violence against school officials "could be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes.") Garland has never equated parents to terrorists. In fact, before McCarthy started spreading this falsehood, Garland had told Congress he "can't imagine" a circumstance under which that would happen.
" My plan would reduce the average family's annual utility bills by $500 "
- Biden, May 30
Biden, in an opinion article, claimed that utility executives had told him his American Rescue Plan would make a dent in inflation by reducing utility bills by $500. But it turned out that the executives said no such thing. The $500 figure had been plucked by White House staffers from a research report examining Biden's climate change policies. The saving was predicted to take place eight years from now - not a lot of help with the current inflation problem, which was the frame of Biden's op-ed. Moreover, the report said the savings on utility bills was no more than $5. So the president was off by a factor of 100.
" Modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia "
- Vladimir Putin, Feb. 21
Russian President Vladimir Putin justified his invasion of Ukraine with a lengthy, often-bitter televised speech filled with falsehoods. He tried to minimize Ukraine as a recent creation, an obscure entity that came about after what he described as a struggle between Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin over the contours of a national state. The reality is that Ukrainian culture and language have existed for centuries, and a Ukrainian nationalist movement sprang up in the mid-1800s, angering the czars. Putin also claimed that Ukraine wanted to "create its own nuclear weapons" - which is sheer fantasy. Putin's speech signaled the start of a vast Russian disinformation effort to sway world opinion. (In 2014, Putin's speech on the annexation of Crimea - which included the whopper that the referendum confirming the seizure was "in full compliance with democratic procedures and international norms" - also earned him a spot on this list.)
" A private-equity firm run by Hunter Biden funded some of the research into pathogens in these bio labs "
- Carlson, March 24
After Russia invaded Ukraine, its Defense Ministry claimed that the president's son financed a bioweapons program in Ukraine - which was catnip for right-leaning media figures like Carlson . But the claim was ludicrous. Not only are these not biological weapons labs - they are civilian biological research facilities - but Hunter Biden was not part of a decision to invest in a company at the center of the Russian allegations, he did not profit from it as he was kicked out of the investment firm over cocaine allegations, and the company made little money from its tiny bit of business in Ukraine.
The Chips Act "will create more than 1 million construction jobs "
- Biden, Aug. 11
The Chips and Science Act will provide nearly $53 billion for U.S. semiconductor research, development, manufacturing and workforce development. But Biden was wildly off base when he claimed during remarks at the signing ceremony and in a tweet that it would create 1 million construction jobs. The real number was just 6,200 construction jobs, according to the industry-commissioned report cited as the source. Moreover, other experts were skeptical of the way even these numbers were calculated in the report. Yet, the White House never deleted the widely shared tweet or corrected the record.
"We've heard story after story. I mean, all these athletes dropping dead on the field" from the coronavirus vaccine
- Ron Johnson, Jan. 27
Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) kept drawing attention to a claim that has been debunked repeatedly. The story of athletes dropping dead after receiving coronavirus vaccines has its roots in mysterious websites in Austria with ties to that country's far-right populist party, the Freedom Party. Those stories were then recycled by right-wing media in the United States, where it caught his attention. A kernel of truth - some people have been found to have an inflammation of the heart muscle, known as myocarditis, after getting mRNA-based vaccines - had been exploited by purveyors of falsehoods. Medical research shows the risk of getting myocarditis from the coronavirus itself is about 100 times higher than getting it from a vaccine.
" How many of those present at the Capitol complex on January 6 were FBI confidential informants? … How about the one guy, 'Go in, go in, get in there, everybody,' [Ray] Epps. 'Get in there, go, go.' Nothing happens to him. "
- Donald Trump, Jan. 15
Former president Donald Trump and supporters such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) baselessly suggested that Ray Epps, a Trump supporter from Arizona who joined the crowd at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, was actually an FBI informant - part of a "breach team" that set a "booby trap" for unwitting Trump supporters. "Clues" drawn from videos of Epps before and during the attack had been twisted into misleading narratives. But there is no evidence that Epps is a federal agent or informant - and testimony revealed he had sought to calm people, not rile them up.
" We have over 100,000 children … in serious condition and many on ventilators "
- Sonia Sotomayor, Jan. 7
During a Supreme Court hearing on whether the Biden administration's nationwide rules ordering a vaccination-or-testing requirement on large employers were constitutional, Justice Sonia Sotomayor made a wildly incorrect statement about the number of children hospitalized with the coronavirus at the time. As of Jan. 8, about 5,000 children were hospitalized in pediatric beds, either with suspected covid-19 or with cases of covid-19 confirmed by laboratory test - a much smaller number than Sotomayor claimed. The number of total hospital admissions of children confirmed to have covid had not yet exceeded 100,000.
Special hypocrisy award
Mark Meadows , as Trump's last chief of staff, helped spread Trump's lies about the 2020 election and fanned fears of electoral fraud. He asked in one interview: "Do you realize how inaccurate the voter rolls are, with people just moving around?" But The Fact Checker revealed that in 2022, he was simultaneously registered to vote in three states - North Carolina, Virginia and South Carolina. He lost his North Carolina registration after the New Yorker magazine reported this year that he had registered to vote at a home where he did not reside. He voted in the 2020 election via North Carolina absentee ballot. In November, state investigators submitted to state prosecutors the findings of a voter-fraud probe into Meadows's actions, but the state's attorney general has not yet announced whether he will bring criminal charges against Meadows.

Full text: It's time for our roundup of the biggest Pinocchios of the year.
False claims made by President Biden and conspiracy theories about the president dominate the list. Misleading claims about the coronavirus, by a Republican and a Democrat, also made the cut. Former president Donald Trump earned this dubious honor for the eighth straight year by spreading a baseless conspiracy theory about one of his supporters at the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.
Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who also appeared on last year's Biggest Pinocchio list, earned two spots this year, while Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) appears in the tally for the second straight year with a coronavirus claim.
This list has no particular order. To read the full fact check, click on the link embedded in the quote.
" It seems like yesterday the first time I got arrested "
— President Biden, Jan. 11
For some unknown reason, President Biden likes to claim he was once arrested. During a speech in Atlanta this year, he did it again — referring to an unverified tale that as a teenager he was arrested for standing on the porch with a Black couple. They supposedly were subject to demonstrations because they bought a home in a White neighborhood near his house. We dug deep into the records and found too many contradictions in Biden's story, including the fact he lived far from the home in question. Biden landed on the Biggest Pinocchio list in 2020 with a similar false claim — that he had been arrested while trying to meet Nelson Mandela.
" If you wanted to kill a bunch of MAGA voters in the middle of the heartland, how better than [for Biden] to target them and their kids with this deadly fentanyl? "
— J.D. Vance, April 29
Sen.-elect J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) made a startlingly false claim shortly after he won the GOP nomination — that Biden was intentionally allowing drugs such as fentanyl to flood the United States with the goal of killing Trump supporters in the "heartland" of the country. But this hyperbolic claim was based on zero facts. Seizures of fentanyl have increased, not fallen, under Biden. Overdose deaths jumped sharply under Trump. As for Trump voters being supposedly targeted, people of color die at a higher rate from opioids than Whites.
Biden is "urging children to report their parents to federal authorities if their parents post something called covid disinformation "
— Tucker Carlson, Aug. 29
Fox News host Tucker Carlson claimed on his show that the Department of Homeland Security was urging children to report their parents if they post covid misinformation on social media. Blake Masters , then a GOP Senate candidate in Arizona, chimed in: "This is Chinese Communist Party stuff." It turns out that this tale stemmed from a rather benign video posted in 2021 aimed at adults about how to evaluate coronavirus claims spread on social media. But it was twisted into something much more sinister through a game of telephone tag in the right-leaning media — before emerging as a ridiculous conspiracy theory on Carlson's show.
" An attorney general who goes after parents and calls them terrorists if they want to go to a school board meeting "
— Kevin McCarthy, April 17
Over and over, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) asserted that Attorney General Merrick Garland called parents "terrorists" because they wanted to attend school board meetings. But McCarthy was relying on a Rube Goldberg artifice to put words in Garland's mouth. (Garland had received a letter from a school association, later withdrawn, that had said threats of violence against school officials "could be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes.") Garland has never equated parents to terrorists. In fact, before McCarthy started spreading this falsehood, Garland had told Congress he "can't imagine" a circumstance under which that would happen.
" My plan would reduce the average family's annual utility bills by $500 "
— Biden, May 30
Biden , in an opinion article, claimed that utility executives had told him his American Rescue Plan would make a dent in inflation by reducing utility bills by $500. But it turned out that the executives said no such thing. The $500-figure had been plucked by White House staff from a research report examining Biden's climate change policies. The savings was predicted to take place eight years from now — not a lot of help with the current inflation problem, which was the frame of Biden's op-ed. Moreover, the report said the savings on utility bills was no more than $5. So the president was off by a factor of 100.
" Modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia "
— Vladimir Putin, Feb. 21
Russian President Vladimir Putin justified his invasion of Ukraine with a lengthy, often-bitter televised speech filled with falsehoods. He tried to minimize Ukraine as a recent creation, an obscure entity that came about after what he described as a struggle between Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin over the contours of a national state. The reality is that Ukrainian culture and language have existed for centuries and a Ukrainian nationalist movement sprang up in the mid-1800s, angering the czars. He also claimed that Ukraine wanted to "create its own nuclear weapons" — which is sheer fantasy. Putin's speech signaled the start of a vast Russian disinformation effort designed to sway world opinion. (In 2014, Putin's speech on the annexation of Crimea — which included the whopper that the referendum confirming the seizure was "in full compliance with democratic procedures and international norms" — also earned him a spot on this list.)

Not only are these not biological weapons labs — they are civilian biological research facilities — but Hunter Biden was not part of a decision to invest in a company at the center of the Russian allegations, he did not profit from it as he was kicked out of the investment firm over cocaine allegations, and the company made little money from its tiny bit of business in Ukraine.
The CHIPS Act "will create more than 1 million construction jobs "
— Biden, Aug. 11
The Chips and Science Act will provide nearly $53 billion for U.S. semiconductor research, development, manufacturing and workforce development. But Biden was wildly off base when he claimed it would create 1 million construction jobs during remarks at the signing ceremony and in a tweet. The real number was just 6,200 construction jobs, according to the industry-commissioned report cited as the source. Moreover, other experts were skeptical of the way even these numbers were calculated in the report. Yet the White House never deleted the widely shared tweet or corrected the record.

— Sonia Sotomayor, Jan. 7
During a Supreme Court hearing on whether the Biden administration's nationwide rules ordering a vaccination-or-testing requirement on large employers were constitutional, Justice Sonia Sotomayor made a wildly incorrect statement about the number of children hospitalized with the coronavirus at the time. As of Jan. 8, there were about 5,000 children hospitalized in a pediatric bed, either with suspected covid or a confirmed laboratory test — much smaller than Sotomayor claimed. The number of total hospital admissions of children confirmed with covid had not yet exceeded 100,000.

Full text: GROSS STRÖMKENDORF, Germany — The news clip showed a towering blaze in a residential neighborhood in Germany, followed by a weeping homeowner giving an interview from the rubble of her burned-down house. A chyron at the bottom of the screen explained that Ukrainian refugees had set the fire, accidentally ravaging the home of their German hosts.
The video, which bore the logo of the German tabloid Bild, spread from a small YouTube account through the messaging app Telegram to Russian state media, until it could be found on nearly every major social platform, a forensic analysis later showed.
But it was a fake, with footage from unrelated events stitched together to form a bogus news report that cast Ukrainian refugees as feckless instigators wreaking havoc on the generous Germans who had taken them in.
As Russian forces continue to shell Ukrainian cities, pro-Kremlin propagandists have homed in on a new target: turning Europeans against the 7.8 million Ukrainian refugees who make up the continent's largest displacement since World War II. In doing so, Russia's disinformation merchants are needling at deep-seated European fault lines over immigration, echoing how Russia-linked operatives famously exploited major U.S. social media platforms to sow division around topics such as race ahead of the 2016 presidential election.
Experts say the propaganda campaign, which Facebook parent company Meta has called "the largest and most complex Russian-origin operation that we've disrupted since the beginning of the war in Ukraine," aims to stoke fear and divisions among Ukraine's critical European allies as they brace for a new influx of refugees this winter. And while Europeans remain overwhelmingly supportive of fleeing Ukrainians, there are fears that Russian efforts to weaponize the issue may be finding their mark.
In Germany — home to more than 1 million Ukrainians — attempted arson attacks and threatening graffiti on refugee accommodations and schools in recent months suggest the messaging is already reaching a radicalized fringe. In many cases, it's spreading via the fast-growing messaging app Telegram, which does far less content moderation than established giants such as Meta's Facebook and Google's YouTube.
One morning in October, at a local hotel that was converted into a refugee center run by the Red Cross in Gross Strömkendorf, a village on Germany's north coast, someone used spray paint to turn the Red Cross sign into the shape of a bright red swastika. Two days after the swastika attack, the hotel was burned down — not by its Ukrainian inhabitants, but by a German serial arsonist, authorities say. They say they don't believe the fire was politically motivated. All 14 refugees escaped unharmed.
Russian disinformation "is a long-term investment, and it could become very, very toxic," Huberta von Voss, executive director of the Germany office for the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based nonprofit that studies extremism and disinformation, said of the Russian efforts. "That can do real-world harm."
While Europeans are still overwhelmingly in favor of welcoming refugees, support is slipping in key countries. A poll by the Bertelsmann Foundation found that the proportion of Germans who believe the country should take in refugees from Ukraine fell from 86 percent in March, near the beginning of the war, to 74 percent in September.
"Lies about Ukrainian refugees and efforts to capitalize on Europeans' fears have not successfully polarized or shaped the public discourse so far," according to a recent European Parliament-supported study by the Brussels-based European Policy Center. But the proportion of information that is hostile toward Ukrainian refugees "is increasing and generating greater engagement on social media," it warned.
Russian disinformation narratives have also seeped into mainstream politics. In September, Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany's opposition Christian Democrats, accused Ukrainian refugees of "social tourism" — taking advantage of Germany's welfare system while traveling back and forth to Ukraine, a narrative frequently touted by pro-Kremlin accounts. He later apologized.
And there are indications that anti-refugee propaganda may be finding its mark among an already radicalized fringe taking to the streets for weekly demonstrations against energy prices.
In one incident in the eastern city of Leipzig in October, marchers faced off against a group of Ukrainian refugees demonstrating against Russia's bombardment. One protester called the group of Ukrainians "pigs," adding, "You are living on our dime," as others chanted, "Nazis out." (Equating Ukrainians with Nazis has been a dominant theme of Russian propaganda since President Vladimir Putin sought to justify the invasion as a campaign to "de-Nazify" the country.)
Kateryna Pikalova, a 26-year-old from the Ukrainian city of Dnipro who helped organize the Ukrainian demonstration, described the scene as "chaos" but said she was not surprised. She recalled a recent incident when she and her mother, who recently arrived as a refugee, were approached by a man on the street who began comparing Ukrainians to Nazis, referring to images he'd seen online.
"You hear this on the street, and you understand that this Russian psychological operation is in action," Pikalova said. "This Russian big machine is unstoppable, it's everywhere. You can see it on the internet, you can feel it on the streets."
Disinformation fault lines The demonization of Ukrainian refugees in Germany via social media hoaxes and bogus news stories represents a characteristically insidious strand of disinformation, experts say, from Russian propagandists, who have long shown a knack for tapping into other countries' domestic political divisions to advance their aims.
Europe's largest economy has been central to Moscow's informational warfare since the Cold War, when the country was the dividing line between east and west. That is still a fault line Russian propaganda attempts to exploit, while in recent years Kremlin information operations have also focused on stirring the backlash against Germany's decision to allow in more than a million largely Middle Eastern refugees.
And Germany is a country where Russian channels have reach. Before it was shut down by German authorities in March, RT DE, the German language arm of Russian state television channel Russia Today, was the most interacted with German language media outlet on Facebook, and the third on Twitter, according to a study last year by the German Marshall Fund.
The anti-refugee narrative began as the first fleeing Ukrainians crossed the border, but took off in the spring and summer, after early attempts to justify Russia's February invasion or play it down as a "special military operation" did not persuade Western audiences.
Whereas past waves of disinformation targeting Middle Eastern refugees portrayed them as a "cultural" threat to Europeans, the campaign against Ukrainian refugees presents them as a threat to Europeans' health and wealth, the European Policy Center found.
A growing body of research makes clear that the anti-refugee messaging has been fueled by a sprawling, coordinated, Russia-based network of fake news websites, Telegram channels, YouTube and Instagram channels, and even Change.org petitions. And it's being systematically amplified by armies of fake social media accounts, real pro-Kremlin influencers, and Russian state media accounts across virtually every major social platform.
Exactly who in Russia is behind it is not yet clear, and researchers have yet to find direct links to the Kremlin. But whoever it is appears to be well-resourced, experienced in disinformation campaigns, and very persistent. In a September report on the network, Facebook parent Meta said the campaign relied on "an unusual combination of sophistication and brute force."
New research by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, shared with The Washington Post ahead of its publication, provides the most detailed insight yet into the disinformation campaign, highlighting its focus on Ukrainian refugees and tracing how the campaign worked to push specific narratives to European audiences.
The ISD report focuses on a specific Telegram channel with about 10,000 followers, called Deutsche Wahrheit ("German Truth"), as a microcosm of the broader campaign. Though the channel's name and posts were in German, researchers noticed that the file names of the videos and clips it uploaded were often in Russian. Those files also included folder names and project names that matched those found on videos posted by accounts previously identified as part of a pro-Kremlin propaganda network.
Out of 219 videos posted in Deutsche Wahrheit between April 15 and July 11, 40 percent mentioned refugees, according to the ISD study. Other videos sought to link Ukraine more generally to Nazism, discredit specific Ukrainian leaders, or blame Europe's energy woes and inflation on its support of Ukraine.
The posts, many of which featured faked or doctored videos made to look like mainstream media reports, implicated Ukrainian refugees in everything from plotting terrorist attacks to bringing monkeypox to Germany.
The faked clip that appeared to show Ukrainian refugees burning down their German hosts' house in Wulfen was one of those. Its spread offers a case study in how the campaign used small, obscure accounts to seed and perhaps focus-group falsehoods that it could then spread to wider audiences, staying a step ahead of the big platforms' content moderators.
On May 14, someone created a German-language YouTube channel with a name that translates to "News and Rumors," according to ISD's forensic analysis, and uploaded the faked Bild news clip. It received a paltry 12 likes and was later deleted. YouTube didn't respond to requests for comment.
That same day, however, the video was uploaded to the Deutsche Wahrheit Telegram channel, which appears to have served as an early or original source for numerous videos in the campaign. Posting on Twitter on May 17, Bild's head of Digital, Timo Lokoschat, denounced the report as a "complete fake" — but that didn't stop its spread. Bild didn't respond to requests for comment.
By the next day, the video was making the rounds of large Russian-language Telegram channels, some with hundreds of thousands of subscribers. On May 19, it made headlines across Russian media, including Sputnik and the news agency RIA FAN. It also spread to Chinese social media site Weibo, where it was viewed hundreds of thousands of times.
Though the video was eventually debunked, few of the stories were ever corrected or retracted. And links to the articles and videos continued circulating on Telegram, Twitter and Facebook, where fake accounts with AI-generated profile images systematically amplified them.
The German public television network, ZDF, first tied a spate of such faked news videos, which purported to be from German outlets such as Bild, Die Welt and Der Spiegel, to a coordinated disinformation campaign in August. ZDF noted that some of the fake videos were being promoted in Facebook advertisements.
That triggered Meta's investigation, which identified dozens more fake news sites and examples of disinformation targeting European audiences, primarily in Germany, and attributed the campaign to Russian origins. Meta took down all the ones it could find. While Deutsche Wahrheit's Instagram account survived those sweeps, Meta spokeswoman Margarita Franklin confirmed that it was part of the same campaign, and Instagram suspended it in November following The Post's inquiries.
Such investigations have become part of Facebook's business, and to a lesser extent those of Twitter and YouTube, since they first identified evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.
But as content moderation has increased on the major U.S.-based social platforms, propagandists and extremists have found new outlets.
Those include Telegram, the stateless messaging app that has become a leading communications channel in much of Eastern Europe, including Russia and Ukraine.
Similar anti-refugee disinformation campaigns linked to "hacktivism" groups in Russia and neighboring Belarus have been targeting Polish audiences, said Givi Gigitashvili, a Poland-based research associate for the nonprofit Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab.
Telegram spokesperson Remi Vaughn defended the company's role in the information ecosystem. Vaughn did not dispute that Telegram takes a laissez-faire attitude to channels that spread misinformation, but said it is working to expand a fact-checking initiative. "It is our belief that the most powerful tool against misinformation is the spread of verified information," Vaughn said.
Only about 2 million Germans subscribe to Telegram channels, Vaughn added, making it "unlikely Telegram channels could play any noticeable role in Germany's information landscape, let alone be used as a tool for disinformation of any relevance."
But German authorities warned the messaging app has become a "medium for radicalization," and in October a court fined the company $5 million for failing to comply with German law regarding the reporting of illegal content.
A string of incidents in recent years — including a plot to kidnap the health minister — have stoked fears that online extremism fueled by misinformation and conspiracy theories is increasingly manifesting into offline violence.
On Wednesday, German authorities arrested 25 members of what they described as a "terrorist group" suspected of plotting to storm parliament and overthrow the state by force. Prosecutors said members followed a mix of conspiracy theories and accuse its ringleader of reaching out to Russian officials during his attempts to bring about a new order in Germany.
'The discontent of the people' Pinpointing the role of Russian propaganda amid domestic extremism can be tricky, because foreign and domestic actors often work in concert, said Pia Lamberty, co-CEO of CeMAS, a German think tank that tracks online conspiracy theories and extremism. "There's a certain atmosphere created online, and this gives people the idea that they need to do something about it" — sometimes in the form of real-world hate crimes.
During the summer, graffiti in poorly spelled English reading "kill Ukrain kids" was sprayed on a school that teaches refugees in the eastern German city of Leipzig, while another kindergarten in the city attended by Ukrainians was targeted in an attempted arson. In October, a planned home for non-Ukrainian refugees was set fire to in Bautzen, Saxony.
Bild branded the hamlet of Gross Strömkendorf, situated on a picturesque inlet of the Baltic Sea, where the Red Cross refugee center was defaced and then burned to the ground, the "village of shame" in a column.
So far, attacks on refugee centers have only risen slightly amid the strain of more than a million new arrivals. There were 65 in Germany through October of this year, according to official figures cited by the German press, compared to 70 all last year, before the Ukrainian wave began. That compares to a peak of around 1,000 in 2015, as more than a million largely Middle Eastern refugees arrived in the country.
But there has been an increasingly "bad vibe" toward refugees in recent months, said Ulrike Seemann-Katz, the head of the refugee council for Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the state where the burned down refugee center was located.
And as winter sets in, officials have said they expect an uptick in arrivals from the front lines in Ukraine, as Russian shelling inflicts severe damage to Ukrainian infrastructure — just as the impact of the energy crisis could be felt most strongly in Germany. Seeman-Katz said her organization has had an influx of emails asking them to give aid to Germans instead of refugees.
"Sometimes it doesn't even have to be insults — often they just make statements based on Russian propaganda," she said.
Anti-refugee sentiment has been fueled by weekly street demonstrations around Germany, said Seeman-Katz. Regular demonstrations against coronavirus vaccines and lockdown mandates have morphed into protests over the war and high energy prices, and anti-refugee sentiment has also bubbled up.
On a Monday in late October, in Germany's northern city of Schwerin, hundreds of demonstrators gathered at the steps of the city's 19th-century museum next to a banner asking, "Do you want to starve or freeze?"
Attendees carried Russian and German flags, and a speaker read a supposed "testimony" from a worker in the energy industry warning of a collapse in the grid. "You may have read it already in the channels," he began, referring to Telegram. The crowd swelled to several thousand as night fell.
A 64-year-old retiree wearing a string of fairy lights around her felt hat said she sees Ukrainian refugee children with new bicycles. "There are German children who can't afford that," she said. "Why does a refugee have to ride a bike? A refugee can walk."
She complained that state support meant refugees could leave windows open while having the heat on, while pensioners struggled to pay their bills. The woman spoke on the condition of anonymity because she feared potential repercussions, and like others at the demonstration expressed a distrust of the "mainstream media."
The retiree, who said she went to Telegram for her news, had heard about the fire at the refugee center in Gross Strömkendorf about 25 miles north, which at the time was assumed to be a targeted attack. "The fire is not okay," said the woman, "but the discontent of the people you can understand."
Morris also reported from Schwerin and Berlin. Oremus reported from Newark, Del. Vanessa Guinan-Bank in Berlin and Gross Strömkendorf contributed to this report.

Full text: The Biden administration has pushed social media giants like Facebook to curb Covid misinformation. But it is thriving on fringe platforms like Gab, a hub for extremist content.
WASHINGTON -- Not long after Randy Watt died of Covid-19, his daughter Danielle sat down at her computer, searching for clues as to why the smart and thoughtful man she knew had refused to get vaccinated. She pulled up Google, typed in a screen name he had used in the past and discovered a secret that stunned her.
Her father, she learned, had a hidden, virtual life on Gab, a far-right social media platform that traffics in Covid misinformation. And there was another surprise as well: As he fought the coronavirus, he told his followers that he was taking ivermectin, a drug used to treat parasitic infections that experts say has no benefit -- and in fact can be dangerous -- for patients with Covid-19.
"On two occasions I coughed so hard that larynx went into spasm and closed my airway," he wrote in a post on Gab a few days before Christmas last year. "Frightening, yes, but relaxing instead of panicking allowed the airway to open in 15 to 20 seconds. Took second dose of ivermectin, along with ibuprofen for fever and my usual vitamin regimen. Rest, fluids, and prayer."
Mr. Watt, a passionate songwriter and musician who loved the outdoors and had retired from an energy company in Ohio, died on Jan. 7. He was 64. His wife and two daughters are still struggling to understand what led him to a site like Gab, which his widow, Victoria Stefan Watt, blames for what she called his "senseless death."
Around the country, countless Americans are suffering a very particular type of Covid grief -- a mixture of anger, sorrow and shame that comes with losing a loved one who has consumed social media falsehoods. On Tuesday, in what was likely his last appearance in the White House briefing room before he retires from government service at the end of the year, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser, pleaded with Americans to speak out against scientific misinformation.
"The people who have correct information, who take science seriously, who don't have strange, way-out theories about things but who base what they say on evidence and data, need to speak up more," Dr. Fauci said, "because the other side that just keeps putting out misinformation and disinformation seems to be tireless in that effort."
Experts say the spread of health misinformation -- particularly on fringe social media platforms like Gab -- is likely to be a lasting legacy of the coronavirus pandemic. And there are no easy solutions.
"There has been such an incredible focus on developing vaccines quickly," said Tara Kirk Sell, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, adding: "But from my perspective, there's a missing piece there -- a missing social behavioral piece. You can get a vaccine out to people in 100 days but they think it's poison? You've still got a big problem."
In preparation for future pandemics, the White House recently released a new national biodefense strategy that calls for the government to "enhance messaging partnerships" before another biological threat emerges. The goal, said Dr. Raj Panjabi, Mr. Biden's top adviser on global health security, is to work with "reputable companies who care about getting the message right."
But fighting misinformation has become political in itself -- and has landed the Biden administration in court, opposite the attorneys general in Louisiana and Missouri, both Republicans, who have accused it of suppressing free speech on matters like Covid-19 and elections by working with social media giants including Facebook and Twitter.
Dr. Fauci will be deposed in that case on Wednesday. On Monday, a federal appeals court, siding with the Justice Department, put on hold a lower court's order requiring Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, the surgeon general, and two other administration officials to sit for their own depositions.
It will not be so easy for the government to team up with smaller fringe sites like Gab, a hub for white supremacists and online conspiracy theories whose founder, Andrew Torba, argues that "unapologetic Christian Nationalism is what will save the United States of America." The site, which gained millions of new users after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, is rife with posts promoting unproven Covid-19 remedies, including ivermectin. It also has displayed ads offering ivermectin for sale.
In an email to The New York Times, Mr. Torba said Gab was "not in a position, as a neutral platform provider, to 'fact-check' our users or assess the truth or falsity of any information posted to the site." He also criticized The Times and ended his message with an instruction: "Please repent and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior."
It is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify the precise toll that Covid misinformation has taken on American society, but scholars are trying. In a report published last year, Dr. Sell and her colleagues estimated that 5 to 30 percent of unvaccinated Americans were influenced by Covid falsehoods. At George Washington University, Sarah Wagner, a social anthropologist who researches death and mourning, has a three-year grant from the National Science Foundation to study the effects of Covid misinformation.
Mr. Watt was not a Covid denier, his family says. His elder daughter, Jessica Watt Dougherty, describes him as "a spiritual person" -- a private man who loved Neil Young's music; played guitar, banjo and harmonica; and wore his gray hair long like a "leftover hippie." He passed his musical gifts to his grandchildren, teaching them to play guitar.
When an energy company proposed running a pipeline through his Ohio neighborhood, just south of Akron, Mr. Watt helped lead the fight against it, testifying in government hearings, filing a lawsuit and writing a country song, "Get Mad." He was a Republican, but he was quiet about his politics. He and his daughters never spoke of it.
"My husband questioned authority," Ms. Stefan Watt said. On politics, she said, they agreed to disagree.
Early in the pandemic, Mr. Watt was "hypervigilant with protocol," according to his wife. He wore masks and ordered groceries online to avoid crowded stores. But at some point, like many Americans unsure of whom or what to believe, Mr. Watt began questioning public health authorities. He felt that they were fear-mongering and that things were not as bad as they said.
Sometime in December 2020, just as coronavirus vaccines started to become available, he joined Gab -- without his family's knowledge. His daughters say they do not know what drew him there. His wife thinks he was depressed, stuck at home and feeling isolated in his retirement, and "went down the rabbit hole" into a world that did not reflect who he was.
Mr. Watt soon expressed his disappointment with the site, noting in March 2021 that he had paid $ 500 for a lifetime membership without receiving much in return. He called Gab "a cesspool," adding that he was "forced to doubt nearly 9/10 of what I read."
Still, Mr. Watt stuck around, eventually posting or reposting more than 3,200 messages. He wrote disparagingly of Mr. Biden and admiringly of former President Donald J. Trump. He also shared posts promoting ivermectin, which the Food and Drug Administration had been warning against as a Covid treatment.
In a post in April 2021, Mr. Watt wondered if Covid-19 could be "overcome by inexpensive treatments such as simple Vitamin D, Vitamin C, ivermectin" and hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug promoted by Mr. Trump.
"Who should I trust?" Mr. Watt wrote. "Big government? Media? When was the last time they steered me in the right direction without lies and chicanery?"
In a country that values freedom of speech, tamping down falsehoods on social media is tricky business for policymakers and health officials in Washington. Mr. Torba has positioned Gab as a "First Amendment company," as he put it, "which means we tolerate 'offensive' but legal speech."
Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor at Georgetown University and an expert in public health law, said the administration would be on "weak legal footing if it tries to regulate these companies." Misinformation and disinformation, he said, amount to "probably the central problem for public health and safety in America, and yet no one knows what to do about it."
Mr. Biden has tried using his bully pulpit. Last year, after the surgeon general declared misinformation "an urgent threat to public health," the president publicly accused platforms like Facebook of "killing people." Administration officials also met and communicated with officials from social media companies to coordinate and promote accurate messages about Covid-19.
The two Republican attorneys general, Eric Schmitt of Missouri and Jeff Landry of Louisiana, argued that the officials had colluded to suppress free speech and filed a suit in May. In July, a federal judge ordered the Biden administration to turn over communications between administration officials and social media companies. Mr. Schmitt and Mr. Landry said that messages released in response were proof of a vast "censorship enterprise."
Gab, founded in 2016, was not a "huge anti-vaccine gathering point" early in the pandemic, said David Thiel, a data and technology expert at Stanford University who published an analysis of Gab in June. But that changed, he said, after vaccines arrived and the major social media platforms began cracking down on Covid falsehoods. The flood of new users to Gab after the Jan. 6 attack amplified its anti-vaccine content, he said.
In his email to The Times, Mr. Torba acknowledged that Gab users had been able to make statements that would not have been permitted on Facebook and Twitter, and he suggested that The Times and other mainstream news outlets had "parroted" the government's statements about Covid-19.
"These false assertions," he wrote, "were questioned by Gab users who were free to speak about these topics on our platform in ways they would not have been able to on Twitter and Facebook."
When vaccines became widely available in the winter and spring of last year, Ms. Stefan Watt said, both she and her husband were cautious; they wanted to see how other people fared. At one point, she thought both of them would get vaccinated together. But Mr. Watt balked and grew more adamant over time.
"I have received FLU vaccines for decades with no ill results," he wrote on Gab in September 2021. But now, he said, "I am extremely wary of taking ANY vax in fear that I'll receive a Covid jab."
Mr. Watt's wife and daughters said they did not argue with his decision. "I was raised with, 'What my dad says goes,"' Ms. Watt Dougherty said, adding, "It was not something that I pushed." Now she regrets that and feels guilty.
On Dec. 26, 2021, after feeling ill for four weeks and refusing to get tested, Mr. Watt finally took himself to the hospital. Doctors threw all manner of Covid-19 treatments at him: steroids, the antiviral drug remdesivir and tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody authorized by the F.D.A. for Covid on an emergency basis for patients who are also getting oxygen.
He told his wife that he regretted his decision not to get vaccinated and was finally ready to do it. It was too late. On Jan. 4, he recorded a goodbye video. "I'm Randy Watt," he said from behind an oxygen mask, with monitors beeping in the background. "I'm 64. And chances are I'm dying."
For those left behind, a death linked to Covid misinformation carries its own kind of trauma. Dr. Wagner of George Washington University calls it "troubled grief." Many families are suffering in silence. Some fight over how much information to reveal; they do not want to embarrass their loved ones -- or worse, to have them mocked and caricatured on schadenfreude-laden websites. Some insist on leaving Covid-19 out of the obituary.
"They don't want the epithet of Covid attached to the name," said Martha Greenwald, the curator of the WhoWeLost Project, which collects stories written by bereaved friends and relatives.
The Watt family is no exception. Ms. Watt Dougherty, a school counselor, is processing her grief by throwing herself into activism. She is working with a group called Marked by Covid, which is pushing for a national memorial to Covid victims, and is collaborating with a filmmaker friend on a documentary about Covid misinformation.
But her stepmother and her sister strongly object to the film, fearing it will paint Mr. Watt in an unfavorable light and viewing Ms. Watt Dougherty's work on it as a betrayal. The sisters, once so close they considered themselves soul mates, no longer speak.
"I'm grieving losing two people -- my father and my sister," Danielle Watt said.
Ms. Watt does not hold Gab accountable for her father's death. "He made the choice not to get vaccinated and unfortunately Covid took his life," she wrote in an email. "There is not always a place to lay blame."
But her older sister, Ms. Watt Dougherty, says sites like Gab need to be held accountable for the falsehoods they spread. The documentary, due out next year, is an effort to do that. She says the film is also part of her "healing journey." It is called "I'm Still Here, Love" -- words Mr. Watt wrote from his hospital bed in one of the last text messages he ever sent her.
"This is not about my dad," she said. "My dad is just part of the mess. We are left to pick up all these pieces."

WASHINGTON — Not long after Randy Watt died of COVID-19, his daughter Danielle sat down at her computer, searching for clues as to why the smart and thoughtful man she knew had refused to get vaccinated. She pulled up Google, typed in a screen name he had used in the past and discovered a secret that stunned her.

“I have received FLU vaccines for decades with no ill results,” he wrote on Gab in September 2021. But now, he said, “I am extremely wary of taking ANY vax in fear that I’ll receive a Covid jab.”
Watt’s wife and daughters said they did not argue with his decision. “I was raised with, ‘What my dad says goes,’” Watt Dougherty said, adding, “It was not something that I pushed.” Now she regrets that and feels guilty.
On Dec. 26, after feeling ill for four weeks and refusing to get tested, Watt finally took himself to the hospital. Doctors threw all manner of COVID-19 treatments at him: steroids, antiviral drug remdesivir and tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody authorized by the FDA for COVID-19 on an emergency basis for patients who are also getting oxygen.
He told his wife that he regretted his decision not to get vaccinated and was finally ready to do it. It was too late. On Jan. 4, he recorded a goodbye video. “I’m Randy Watt,” he said from behind an oxygen mask, with monitors beeping in the background. “I’m 64. And chances are I’m dying.”
For those left behind, a death linked to COVID-19 misinformation carries its own kind of trauma. Wagner of George Washington University calls it “troubled grief.” Many families are suffering in silence. Some fight over how much information to reveal; they do not want to embarrass their loved ones — or worse, to have them mocked and caricatured on schadenfreude-laden websites. Some insist on leaving COVID-19 out of the obituary.
“They don’t want the epithet of COVID attached to the name,” said Martha Greenwald, the curator of the WhoWeLost Project, which collects stories written by bereaved friends and relatives.
The Watt family is no exception. Watt Dougherty, a school counselor, is processing her grief by throwing herself into activism. She is working with a group called Marked by Covid, which is pushing for a national memorial to COVID-19 victims, and is collaborating with a filmmaker friend on a documentary about COVID-19 misinformation.
But her stepmother and her sister strongly object to the film, fearing it will paint Watt in an unfavorable light and viewing Watt Dougherty’s work on it as a betrayal. The sisters, once so close they considered themselves soul mates, no longer speak.
“I’m grieving losing two people — my father and my sister,” Danielle Watt said.
She does not hold Gab accountable for her father’s death. “He made the choice not to get vaccinated and unfortunately COVID took his life,” she wrote in an email. “There is not always a place to lay blame.”
But her older sister, Watt Dougherty, says sites like Gab need to be held accountable for the falsehoods they spread. The documentary, due out next year, is an effort to do that. She says the film is also part of her “healing journey.” It is called “I’m Still Here, Love” — words Randy Watt wrote from his hospital bed in one of the last text messages he ever sent her.
“This is not about my dad,” she said. “My dad is just part of the mess. We are left to pick up all these pieces.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

WASHINGTON — Not long after Randy Watt died of COVID-19, his daughter Danielle sat down at her computer, searching for clues as to why the smart and thoughtful man she knew had refused to get vaccinated. She pulled up Google, typed in a screen name he had used in the past and discovered a secret that stunned her.
Her father, she learned, had a hidden, virtual life on Gab, a far-right social media platform that traffics in COVID-19 misinformation. And there was another surprise: As he fought the coronavirus, he told his followers that he was taking ivermectin, a drug used to treat parasitic infections that experts say has no benefit — and in fact can be dangerous — for patients with COVID-19.
“On two occasions I coughed so hard that larynx went into spasm and closed my airway,” he wrote in a post on Gab a few days before Christmas last year. “Frightening, yes, but relaxing instead of panicking allowed the airway to open in 15 to 20 seconds. Took second dose of ivermectin, along with ibuprofen for fever and my usual vitamin regimen. Rest, fluids, and prayer.”
Watt, a passionate songwriter and musician who loved the outdoors and had retired from an energy company in Ohio, died Jan. 7. He was 64. His wife and two daughters are still struggling to understand what led him to a site like Gab, which his widow, Victoria Stefan Watt, blames for what she called his “senseless death.”
Around the country, countless Americans are suffering a very particular type of COVID-19 grief — a mixture of anger, sorrow and shame that comes with losing a loved one who has consumed social media falsehoods. On Tuesday, in what was likely his last appearance in the White House briefing room before he retires from government service at the end of the year, Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, pleaded with Americans to speak out against scientific misinformation.
“The people who have correct information, who take science seriously, who don’t have strange, way-out theories about things but who base what they say on evidence and data, need to speak up more,” Fauci said, “because the other side that just keeps putting out misinformation and disinformation seems to be tireless in that effort.”
Experts say the spread of health misinformation — particularly on fringe social media platforms like Gab — is likely to be a lasting legacy of the coronavirus pandemic. And there are no easy solutions.
“There has been such an incredible focus on developing vaccines quickly,” said Tara Kirk Sell, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, adding: “But from my perspective, there’s a missing piece there — a missing social behavioral piece. You can get a vaccine out to people in 100 days but they think it’s poison? You’ve still got a big problem.”
In preparation for future pandemics, the White House recently released a new national biodefense strategy that calls for the government to “enhance messaging partnerships” before another biological threat emerges. The goal, said Dr. Raj Panjabi, Biden’s top adviser on global health security, is to work with “reputable companies who care about getting the message right.”
But fighting misinformation has become political in itself — and has landed the Biden administration in court, opposite the attorneys general in Louisiana and Missouri, both Republicans, who have accused it of suppressing free speech on matters like COVID-19 and elections by working with social media giants including Facebook and Twitter.
Fauci will be deposed in that case Wednesday. On Monday, a federal appeals court, siding with the Justice Department, put on hold a lower court’s order requiring Dr. Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general, and two other administration officials to sit for their own depositions.
It will not be so easy for the government to team up with smaller fringe sites like Gab, a hub for white supremacists and online conspiracy theories whose founder, Andrew Torba, argues that “unapologetic Christian nationalism is what will save the United States of America.” The site, which gained millions of new users after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, is rife with posts promoting unproven COVID-19 remedies, including ivermectin. It also has displayed ads offering ivermectin for sale.
In an email to The New York Times, Torba said Gab was “not in a position, as a neutral platform provider, to ‘fact-check’ our users or assess the truth or falsity of any information posted to the site.” He also criticized the Times and ended his message with an instruction: “Please repent and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior.”
It is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify the precise toll that COVID-19 misinformation has taken on American society, but scholars are trying. In a report published last year, Sell and her colleagues estimated that 5% to 30% of unvaccinated Americans were influenced by COVID-19 falsehoods. At George Washington University, Sarah Wagner, a social anthropologist who researches death and mourning, has a three-year grant from the National Science Foundation to study the effects of COVID-19 misinformation.
Watt was not a COVID-19 denier, his family says. His elder daughter, Jessica Watt Dougherty, describes him as “a spiritual person” — a private man who loved Neil Young’s music; played guitar, banjo and harmonica; and wore his gray hair long like a “leftover hippie.” He passed his musical gifts to his grandchildren, teaching them to play guitar.
When an energy company proposed running a pipeline through his Ohio neighborhood, just south of Akron, Watt helped lead the fight against it, testifying in government hearings, filing a lawsuit and writing a country song, “Get Mad.” He was a Republican, but he was quiet about his politics. He and his daughters never spoke of it.
“My husband questioned authority,” Stefan Watt said. On politics, she said, they agreed to disagree.
Early in the pandemic, Watt was “hypervigilant with protocol,” according to his wife. He wore masks and ordered groceries online to avoid crowded stores. But at some point, like many Americans unsure of whom or what to believe, Watt began questioning public health authorities. He felt that they were fearmongering and that things were not as bad as they said.
Sometime in December 2020, just as coronavirus vaccines started to become available, he joined Gab — without his family’s knowledge. His daughters say they do not know what drew him there. His wife thinks he was depressed, stuck at home and feeling isolated in his retirement, and “went down the rabbit hole” into a world that did not reflect who he was.
Watt soon expressed his disappointment with the site, noting in March 2021 that he had paid $500 for a lifetime membership without receiving much in return. He called Gab “a cesspool,” adding that he was “forced to doubt nearly 9/10 of what I read.”
Still, Watt stuck around, eventually posting or reposting more than 3,200 messages. He wrote disparagingly of Biden and admiringly of former President Donald Trump. He also shared posts promoting ivermectin, which the Food and Drug Administration had been warning against as a COVID-19 treatment.
In a post in April 2021, Watt wondered if COVID-19 could be “overcome by inexpensive treatments such as simple Vitamin D, Vitamin C, ivermectin” and hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug promoted by Trump.
“Who should I trust?” Watt wrote. “Big government? Media? When was the last time they steered me in the right direction without lies and chicanery?”
In a country that values freedom of speech, tamping down falsehoods on social media is tricky business for policymakers and health officials in Washington. Torba has positioned Gab as a “First Amendment company,” as he put it, “which means we tolerate ‘offensive’ but legal speech.”
Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor at Georgetown University and an expert in public health law, said the administration would be on “weak legal footing if it tries to regulate these companies.” Misinformation and disinformation, he said, amount to “probably the central problem for public health and safety in America, and yet no one knows what to do about it.”
Biden has tried using his bully pulpit. Last year, after the surgeon general declared misinformation “an urgent threat to public health,” the president publicly accused platforms like Facebook of “killing people.” Administration officials also met and communicated with officials from social media companies to coordinate and promote accurate messages about COVID-19.
Two Republican attorneys general, Eric Schmitt of Missouri and Jeff Landry of Louisiana, argued that the officials had colluded to suppress free speech and filed a suit in May. In July, a federal judge ordered the Biden administration to turn over communications between administration officials and social media companies. Schmitt and Landry said that messages released in response were proof of a vast “censorship enterprise.”
Gab, founded in 2016, was not a “huge anti-vaccine gathering point” early in the pandemic, said David Thiel, a data and technology expert at Stanford University who published an analysis of Gab in June. But that changed, he said, after vaccines arrived and the major social media platforms began cracking down on COVID-19 falsehoods. The flood of new users to Gab after the Jan. 6 attack amplified its anti-vaccine content, he said.
In his email to the Times, Torba acknowledged that Gab users had been able to make statements that would not have been permitted on Facebook and Twitter, and he suggested that the Times and other mainstream news outlets had “parroted” the government’s statements about COVID-19.
“These false assertions,” he wrote, “were questioned by Gab users who were free to speak about these topics on our platform in ways they would not have been able to on Twitter and Facebook.”
When vaccines became widely available in the winter and spring of last year, Stefan Watt said, she and her husband were cautious; they wanted to see how other people fared. At one point, she thought both of them would get vaccinated together. But Watt balked and grew more adamant over time.
“I have received FLU vaccines for decades with no ill results,” he wrote on Gab in September 2021. But now, he said, “I am extremely wary of taking ANY vax in fear that I’ll receive a Covid jab.”

Full text: The Biden administration has pushed social media giants like Facebook to curb Covid misinformation. But it is thriving on fringe platforms like Gab, a hub for extremist content.

Gab, founded in 2016, was not a “huge anti-vaccine gathering point” early in the pandemic, said David Thiel, a data and technology expert at Stanford University who published an analysis of Gab in June. But that changed, he said, after vaccines arrived and the major social media platforms began cracking down on Covid falsehoods. The flood of new users to Gab after the Jan. 6 attack amplified its anti-vaccine content, he said.
In his email to The Times, Mr. Torba acknowledged that Gab users had been able to make statements that would not have been permitted on Facebook and Twitter, and he suggested that The Times and other mainstream news outlets had “parroted” the government’s statements about Covid-19.
“These false assertions,” he wrote, “were questioned by Gab users who were free to speak about these topics on our platform in ways they would not have been able to on Twitter and Facebook.”
When vaccines became widely available in the winter and spring of last year, Ms. Stefan Watt said, both she and her husband were cautious; they wanted to see how other people fared. At one point, she thought both of them would get vaccinated together. But Mr. Watt balked and grew more adamant over time.
“I have received FLU vaccines for decades with no ill results,” he wrote on Gab in September 2021. But now, he said, “I am extremely wary of taking ANY vax in fear that I’ll receive a Covid jab.”
Mr. Watt’s wife and daughters said they did not argue with his decision. “I was raised with, ‘What my dad says goes,’” Ms. Watt Dougherty said, adding, “It was not something that I pushed.” Now she regrets that and feels guilty.
On Dec. 26, 2021, after feeling ill for four weeks and refusing to get tested, Mr. Watt finally took himself to the hospital. Doctors threw all manner of Covid-19 treatments at him: steroids, the antiviral drug remdesivir and tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody authorized by the F.D.A. for Covid on an emergency basis for patients who are also getting oxygen.
He told his wife that he regretted his decision not to get vaccinated and was finally ready to do it. It was too late. On Jan. 4, he recorded a goodbye video. “I’m Randy Watt,” he said from behind an oxygen mask, with monitors beeping in the background. “I’m 64. And chances are I’m dying.”
For those left behind, a death linked to Covid misinformation carries its own kind of trauma. Dr. Wagner of George Washington University calls it “troubled grief.” Many families are suffering in silence. Some fight over how much information to reveal; they do not want to embarrass their loved ones — or worse, to have them mocked and caricatured on schadenfreude-laden websites. Some insist on leaving Covid-19 out of the obituary.
“They don’t want the epithet of Covid attached to the name,” said Martha Greenwald, the curator of the WhoWeLost Project, which collects stories written by bereaved friends and relatives.
The Watt family is no exception. Ms. Watt Dougherty, a school counselor, is processing her grief by throwing herself into activism. She is working with a group called Marked by Covid, which is pushing for a national memorial to Covid victims, and is collaborating with a filmmaker friend on a documentary about Covid misinformation.
But her stepmother and her sister strongly object to the film, fearing it will paint Mr. Watt in an unfavorable light and viewing Ms. Watt Dougherty’s work on it as a betrayal. The sisters, once so close they considered themselves soul mates, no longer speak.
“I’m grieving losing two people — my father and my sister,” Danielle Watt said.
Ms. Watt does not hold Gab accountable for her father’s death. “He made the choice not to get vaccinated and unfortunately Covid took his life,” she wrote in an email. “There is not always a place to lay blame.”
But her older sister, Ms. Watt Dougherty, says sites like Gab need to be held accountable for the falsehoods they spread. The documentary, due out next year, is an effort to do that. She says the film is also part of her “healing journey.” It is called “I’m Still Here, Love” — words Mr. Watt wrote from his hospital bed in one of the last text messages he ever sent her.
“This is not about my dad,” she said. “My dad is just part of the mess. We are left to pick up all these pieces.”

Full text: Episode illustrates how vaccine misinformation can rapidly take hold
On Tuesday morning, a Fox News contributor claimed on Twitter that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was set to mandate that schoolchildren get coronavirus vaccines. By Tuesday evening, the claim was being repeated by the nation's most popular cable news show, and had been amplified to millions more on social media.
"The CDC is about to add the Covid vaccine to the childhood immunization schedule, which would make the vax mandatory for kids to attend school," host Tucker Carlson tweeted, sharing a segment from his show that has been viewed more than 1.5 million times online.
But the claim was wrong: The CDC cannot mandate that schoolchildren receive vaccines, a decision left up to states and jurisdictions, the agency and multiple public health officials said. The initial tweet by Nicole Saphier, a radiologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, also misconstrued a planned meeting of CDC advisers, who voted Wednesday to add coronavirus vaccines to the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC), a safety-net program that offers the shots at no cost. A separate meeting set for Thursday would address the agency's immunization schedule for children.
Public health experts said there is a legitimate debate over whether schoolchildren should be required to be vaccinated against the coronavirus - but the incendiary and erroneous claim by the Fox News personalities is the latest example of how critics can twist the facts about the CDC and the coronavirus, potentially contributing to lower vaccination rates, fading trust in federal health officials and other consequences for public health.
"This is an all new level of dangerous misinformation," Jerome M. Adams, who served as U.S. surgeon general during the Trump administration and as Indiana's top health official, wrote in a text message to The Washington Post. "It could both harm kids (by derailing the VFC program, which helps disadvantaged children access vaccines) and endanger health officials (due to angry misinformed parents). We need to be able to have honest conversations about pros and cons of vaccinating children, without resorting to blatant misinformation."
The episode also illustrates how health-care misinformation can rapidly take hold, particularly around the coronavirus vaccine and fueled by many Americans' frustrations and confusion with pandemic policies. But public health experts often feel stymied in their response, uncertain when to engage with false claims spreading virally. And when officials do weigh in, they are often constrained by their more deliberate, sometimes bureaucratic processes.
While some outspoken individuals, like Kavita Patel, a physician and former Obama administration official, took to Twitter on Tuesday evening to criticize the false claims and rebut them point-by-point, federal officials have been more muted in their response. In interviews Tuesday evening, several administration officials said they had no plans to engage with the false claims, worried about amplifying them. But by Wednesday morning, the administration's calculation had changed, following Carlson's segment, amid mounting outrage toward federal health officials as vaccine critics seized on the wrongly reported claim that the CDC was set to mandate the shots for schoolchildren.
"Thanks to @GovRonDeSantis, COVID mandates are NOT allowed in FL, NOT pushed into schools, & I continue to recommend against them for healthy kids," Joseph Ladapo, Florida's surgeon general, wrote on Twitter.
The CDC took to Twitter around noon Wednesday, quoting Carlson's tweet and noting that its independent vaccine advisory committee would vote Thursday "on an updated childhood immunization schedule." The tweet also said: "States establish vaccine requirements for schoolchildren, not ACIP or CDC," and linked to a page that explains state vaccine requirements.
The CDC's response drew criticism from public health experts, who said the agency did not explicitly rebuff Carlson's claim or speak in plain language. Two administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly said they were uncomfortable that the CDC - by quoting Carlson's tweet - had inadvertently amplified the falsehoods in his video.
Meanwhile, Saphier's original tweet was still posted Wednesday evening and had been retweeted more than 2,400 times as of 6 p.m. Asked about Saphier's tweet, Fox News pointed to a second tweet she sent, more than nine hours later, that offered context that states did not always follow CDC recommendations. That tweet had been retweeted 55 times. Saphier also appeared in a Fox News segment Wednesday afternoon, clarifying her comments but reiterating her criticism that the children's vaccines needed further study.
Memorial Sloan Kettering said Saphier did not speak for the institution.
In a statement Wednesday, the CDC said the vaccine panel will be updating its 2023 childhood and adult immunization schedules, including whether to add approved or authorized coronavirus vaccines, as guidance to health-care providers.
"It's important to note that there are no changes in COVID-19 vaccine policy, and this action would simply help streamline clinical guidance for health care providers by including all currently licensed, authorized and routinely recommended vaccines in one document," CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in an email.
The revised immunization schedules would not take effect until January 2023. Early next year is also when the federal government will no longer provide the vaccines free, federal health officials said. The practical impact of including vaccines on the CDC's recommended immunization list means they are typically covered by insurance.
The updated schedule also "is the one place everyone can look to see exactly what all the recommendations are for all vaccines for all ages," said James Campbell, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious diseases, who said the color-coded document is an essential tool for busy clinicians.
Public health experts noted that recommendations issued by CDC's advisory panel do not necessarily translate to state-level mandates. For instance, few states have adopted the panel's 2006 recommendation that adolescents be vaccinated against human papillomavirus, or HPV.
The CDC "has wanted to stay away" from vaccination mandates and consistently defers to local officials, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University associate professor who specializes in vaccine policy.
Polling has found a significant partisan split in perceptions of the CDC and other agencies. Nearly three-quarters of Democrats say they rate officials at the CDC and other public health agencies positively, versus just one-third of Republicans who do so, according to a Pew Research poll conducted in September.
Health care leaders also said the episode underscored the challenge of informing the public about contentious public health issues. Drew Altman, head of the nonpartisan think tank Kaiser Family Foundation, said his organization was focusing on combating health care misinformation "as our next big thing."
"It just isn't enough for us to be in the business of putting out good information. We have to now also be in the business of countering misinformation and deliberate disinformation as well," Altman said.

Full text: Accounts full of election disinformation polarize on new topics, data show
Three days after the 2020 election, Kyle Becker, a former Fox News producer with a modest 15,000 Twitter followers, began tweeting feverishly about election fraud.
"BOMBSHELL," he wrote on Nov. 6, sharing purported revelations that software glitches could have tipped millions of votes from President Donald Trump to challenger Joe Biden.
Becker's tweetstorm quickly went viral, drawing more than 5,000 additional followers to his account in just four hours. By the time a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol two months later, Becker had vaulted into influencer territory, supercharging his Twitter audience to 177,000.
Since Becker, 46, left Fox in fall 2020, he has built his brand as a right-wing pundit. These days, he curates his own online news site; appears as a guest on conservative podcasts and TV shows; and writes a steady stream of viral, often misleading tweets on a range of topics including coronavirus vaccines, the war in Ukraine and the FBI raid on Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence.
Becker is not alone. The 2020 election and its turbulent aftermath fueled a powerful generation of online influencers, a Washington Post data analysis has found, producing sky-high follower counts for an array of conservatives who echoed Trump's false claims of election fraud, known as the "big lie." Some doubled or tripled their audiences on Twitter, while others saw even larger gains - catapulting, like Becker, from relative obscurity to online fame.
These accounts amassed followers despite vows by Big Tech companies to police election disinformation, The Post found. And they have gone on to use their powerful megaphones to shape the national debate on other subjects, injecting fresh waves of distortion into such culture-war topics as transgender rights and critical race theory.
"Once they've gained a level of influence, they can continue to leverage that influence going forward," said Kate Starbird, a leading expert on disinformation at the University of Washington. "Manipulation becomes embedded in the network."
To conduct its analysis, The Post identified 77 of the biggest spreaders of disinformation about the 2020 election, tracked how they built large audiences online and then analyzed how they used their new power to fuel debate on other divisive topics.
The list of 77 was drawn from research by disinformation experts at Stanford, Harvard and Cornell universities, as well as the University of Washington. While the details of their methodologies differed, the researchers all culled Twitter for posts that spread misperceptions about the election and then determined which accounts had racked up the most retweets, spreading the "big lie" most widely.
The list includes many well-known figures, such as Trump himself, his sons Eric and Donald Jr., Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon and others close to the administration. It includes Trump allies who gained fame specifically for their false claims of voter fraud, such as attorneys L. Lin Wood and Sidney Powell, and prominent media figures such as Fox News's Sean Hannity, Jim Hoft of Gateway Pundit and Josh Caplan of Breitbart News.
But it includes many lesser lights as well - conservative pundits, self-described citizen-journalists and others famous mainly for being online. Commentator Candace Owens, right-wing activist Jack Posobiec and You-Tuber Tim Pool are on the list. So are QAnon proponent Tracy Diaz (a.k.a. "Tracy Beanz"), the anonymous @catturd2 account and an Arizona man who went by the handle @prayingmedic before Twitter suspended him following the Jan. 6 insurrection.
By tracking follower counts on Twitter and Facebook, The Post found that this group rose steeply in popularity in the six months before the Jan. 6 riot, gaining a stunning 25 million followers on the two platforms. For those who already boasted massive audiences, most grew their followings by at least 50 percent by posting about election fraud. For those with more modest audiences - about 1 in 5 on the list - the payoff for sowing doubt in the election was even bigger.
Some surged in status: Becker's Twitter audience grew by more than 1,000 percent. Like him, some have turned selling outrage into a day job or lucrative side hustle, collecting ad dollars, donations and speaking fees for disseminating their views.
Most members of the 77, including Trump, either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to be interviewed. Of those who did respond, several defended their behavior online, saying they merely raised questions about complex topics worthy of public scrutiny. Some criticized the tech companies for banning users who tried to engage in public debate about controversial topics.
Pool, for example, sidestepped questions about a litany of tweets pointing out instances of election fraud. In an email exchange, he noted that he has said he believes Biden won the election and that he has repeatedly stated on his podcast "that [Trump is] wrong, that the claims are unproven, and many are easily debunked." He added: "Evidence of fraud is not proof that fraud changed the election."
Becker defended his messages online and denied knowingly spreading misinformation about the election or other topics. Via LinkedIn messages, he criticized The Post's efforts to scrutinize influencers who discuss election fraud, saying it "furthers the persistent media bias that 'right is bad' while 'left is good.' "
"I never used the words the 'election was stolen' or that 'Trump won, Biden lost' or anything like that. I highlighted articles that appeared to be evidence of election malfeasance," Becker wrote. " 'Rigging an election' can mean many things, by the way, and that includes changing laws without the proper legal channels."
The tech companies say they took action to penalize spreaders of election misinformation, especially those who promoted the insurrection. But Twitter banned only 12 of the 77 "big lie" influencers in the period around the 2020 election and the Jan. 6 riot, The Post found, including Trump. (Eight others already had been banned or were banned later.) YouTube - the only major tech company to prohibit claims that the 2020 election was rigged - banned just four of the 77, while Facebook banned only two: Trump and Bannon.
Twitter and Facebook declined to comment on The Post's findings. The companies have said they use other means, short of full bans, to penalize problematic accounts and maintain a strikes system to deal with repeat offenders.
YouTube spokeswoman Ivy Choi provided a statement: "We remove videos that spread violative 'Stop the Steal' narratives and terminate channels that receive three strikes in a 90-day period. As a result, we've removed tens of thousands of videos and terminated a number of channels for violating our Community Guidelines and Terms of Service ."
Of the 77 figures, 57 remain active on Twitter. To gauge their ongoing influence since Jan. 6, The Post measured their follower counts on Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms, along with shares and retweets of posts containing misinformation on an array of topics that have shaped the national conversation since the 2020 election.
The analysis found that the massive megaphones built by posting about election fraud have given the 57 an outsize role in pushing other false and divisive narratives. For example, members of this group wrote five of the top 20 most-shared tweets about "grooming," a homophobic meme that falsely equates teaching children about sexuality with befriending them for purposes of sexual abuse.
In March, Owens had the fourth-most-shared tweet on the subject, a post that urged her 3.1million followers to #boycottDisney because the company's opposition to a Florida law banning teachers from discussing sexuality amounted to support for "Child groomers and pedophiles."
She added: "They have now openly admitted they have a not so secret agenda with your children. This is the death of Disney." Owens declined to comment.
Also in March, members of the group of 77 produced eight of the top 20 tweets about "biolabs," a pro-Russian conspiracy theory that falsely alleges the United States developed dangerous bioweapons in Ukraine. The U.S. State Department has acknowledged funding biological research in the region to prevent disease outbreaks, but in a statement called the bioweapons narrative "outright lies."
And in June 2021, this group helped shape the critical race theory narrative, which involved conservative attacks on public school offerings about America's history of racism. A tweet from Benny Johnson, creative director of the pro-Trump youth group Turning Point USA, was the sixth-most popular on the topic that month. Johnson claimed he had obtained "LEAKED DOCUMENTS" showing Iowa teachers being forced to classify Trump's "Make America Great Again" slogan as racism.
Another tweet by Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk about Virginia parents "being arrested" for opposing critical race theory was the 21st-most popular, with 3,700 retweets. Neither Johnson nor Kirk responded to requests for comment.
All told, these 57 figures have composed roughly a quarter of the most-shared tweets across Twitter on those hot-button topics plus two others - drag queens and ballot harvesting - The Post found. On Facebook, those still active posted more than 10 percent of the top posts on those issues.
Members of the group also continue to seed unproven claims about election fraud, writing about a quarter of the most-retweeted posts on that topic since January 2021, The Post found. The issue continues to resonate with the public: A recent Monmouth University poll found that 29 percent of Americans say Biden won the election because of voter fraud.
After reviewing The Post's findings, Angelo Carusone, president and CEO of Media Matters for America, a liberal group that tracks right-leaning accounts, compared the soaring popularity of the 77 figures to the reshaping of the information landscape in the late 1990s, when Rush Limbaugh and other Republican cable and radio stars rose to prominence.
"What was unleashed during the 'big lie' was nothing less than the next wave of right-wing media figures, influencers, leaders and organizers," Carusone said. The "big lie" was like "a piñata bursting, and these figures were able to repurpose the candy they collected for the next big event."
Recently, many have found a powerful new topic: Elon Musk's on-again-off-again effort to acquire Twitter.
Since Musk announced plans to buy the social media platform in late April, most members of this group have gained at least 50,000 new Twitter followers apiece, The Post found. (Donald Trump Jr. has gained roughly 850,000.) Many have tried to entice Musk to spread their content, with six of them tweeting at him more than 100 times.
Until Musk's Twitter takeover surfaced as an internet obsession, this group found it difficult to re-create the explosive audience-growing conditions of early 2020. Then, pandemic lockdowns and other emergency public health measures were driving online outrage. People flocking to anti-vaccine groups and the violent pro-Trump extremist ideology QAnon created what researchers have described as a mega-network for disinformation well ahead of Election Day.
Many on The Post's list of 77 rode that momentum. Diaz, for example, initially gained notoriety by running a QAnon account. But she soon ventured into election fraud, calling Georgia a "straight banana republic" on Nov. 29, 2020, after a court ruled that state election officials could update voting machine software rather than preserve it for investigations of purported fraud. By the next day, she had gained 7,000 followers. She did not respond to requests for comment left with the Horry County, S.C., Republican Party, where she is a high-ranking official.
Trump was a huge help. His @realdonaldtrump Twitter account interacted with other members of the group of 77 more than 900 times in the frenzied period during and after the election, pushing their content to his 88million followers. After Trump retweeted a Dec. 8, 2020, post calling for state legislatures to "do their jobs" and declare Trump the winner, its anonymous author, MajorPatriot, gained 7,000 followers in about seven hours. The Post was unable to find contact information for the account, which has since been suspended.
On Jan. 8, 2021, Twitter permanently banned Trump, citing "the risk of further incitement of violence." Other major social media companies soon followed, purging not just Trump but others among the 77, including 8kun co-owner Ron Watkins, "Stop the Steal" activist Michael Coudrey, Powell, MajorPatriot and Beanz. Twitter also removed more than 70,000 accounts tied to QAnon, silencing others on The Post's list, including Gateway Pundit's Hoft and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell.
Reaction to the purges was swift: Republican leaders decried "Big Tech censorship" and encouraged their supporters to switch to a growing crop of right-leaning social media services such as Gettr, Gab and Trump's struggling Truth Social. But nearly two years later, virtually all of the election fraud influencers are more active on major platforms than on any of the right-wing services, The Post found.
Among them is Benny Johnson, who publicly swore off Twitter in 2020 and asked fellow conservatives to defect to other platforms. Today, Johnson is a prolific Twitter user, typically tweeting 25 times a day to more than 812,000 followers.
Recently, some of the "big lie" influencers have returned anew to the topic of election fraud. In May, Dinesh D'Souza, himself a member of the 77, released "2000 Mules," a documentary that purports to expose fraud in the 2020 election. As the film gained attention online, half of the 77 posted about it on Twitter or Facebook.
Joan Donovan, a leading disinformation expert with the Technology and Social Change Research Project at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University, said she worries that this group's continuing influence on society transcends mere misinformation.
Kirk, for instance, has used a Turning Point live event, streamed on YouTube, to issue a "challenge" to "every man across America" to "intervene" at women's sporting events and physically confront transgender athletes.
Meanwhile, several among the 77 have retweeted Chaya Raichik to their large audiences, helping fuel the meteoric rise of her Twitter account, Libs of TikTok. The account, which soared from fewer than 1,000 followers in early 2021 to 1.3 million today, criticizes teachers, medical providers and others who serve transgender children and teens. It was recently suspended after a post led to death threats against providers at Boston Children's Hospital, and a bomb threat caused the hospital to be evacuated.
Becker has retweeted, replied to or tagged Libs of TikTok over 300 times since August 2021. Via LinkedIn, he said: "I stand behind Libs of TikTok and her curation of the radical left's extreme degradation of the culture and its attacks on children's mental and physical health."
"Telling lies and distortions, propagating hateful commentary around racial justice and trans rights, has become very profitable for a small group of people for whom disinformation is now a profession," Donovan said. "You have to keep refreshing novelty and outrage to keep people engaged. You have to refresh the constant soap opera. You have to create the news cycle - without Trump."

Full text: Three days after the 2020 election, Kyle Becker, a former Fox News producer with a modest 15,000 Twitter followers, began tweeting feverishly about election fraud.
"BOMBSHELL," he wrote on Nov. 6, sharing purported revelations that software glitches could have tipped millions of votes from President Donald Trump to challenger Joe Biden.
Becker's tweetstorm quickly went viral, drawing more than 5,000 additional followers to his account in just four hours. By the time a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol two months later, Becker had vaulted into influencer territory, supercharging his Twitter audience to 177,000.
Since Becker, 46, left Fox in fall 2020, he has built his brand as a right-wing pundit. These days, he curates his own online news site; appears as a guest on conservative podcasts and TV shows; and writes a steady stream of viral, often misleading tweets on a range of topics including coronavirus vaccines, the war in Ukraine and the FBI raid on Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence.
Becker is not alone. The 2020 election and its turbulent aftermath fueled a powerful generation of online influencers, a Washington Post data analysis has found, producing sky-high follower counts for an array of conservatives who echoed Trump's false claims of election fraud, known as the "big lie." Some doubled or tripled their audiences on Twitter, while others saw even larger gains — catapulting, like Becker, from relative obscurity to online fame.
These accounts amassed followers despite vows by Big Tech companies to police election disinformation, The Post found. And they have gone on to use their powerful megaphones to shape the national debate on other subjects, injecting fresh waves of distortion into such culture-war topics as transgender rights and critical race theory.
"Once they've gained a level of influence, they can continue to leverage that influence going forward," said Kate Starbird, a leading expert on disinformation at the University of Washington. "Manipulation becomes embedded in the network."
To conduct its analysis, The Post identified 77 of the biggest spreaders of disinformation about the 2020 election, tracked how they built large audiences online and then analyzed how they used their new power to fuel debate on other divisive topics.
The list of 77 was drawn from research by disinformation experts at Stanford, Harvard and Cornell universities, as well as the University of Washington. While the details of their methodologies differed, the researchers all culled Twitter for posts that spread misperceptions about the election and then determined which accounts had racked up the most retweets, spreading the "big lie" most widely.
The list includes many well-known figures, such as Trump himself, his sons Eric and Donald Jr., Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon and others close to the administration. It includes Trump allies who gained fame specifically for their false claims of voter fraud, such as attorneys L. Lin Wood and Sidney Powell, and prominent media figures such as Fox News's Sean Hannity, Jim Hoft of Gateway Pundit and Josh Caplan of Breitbart News.
But it includes many lesser lights as well — conservative pundits, self-described citizen-journalists and others famous mainly for being online. Commentator Candace Owens, right-wing activist Jack Posobiec and YouTuber Tim Pool are on the list. So are QAnon proponent Tracy Diaz (a.k.a. "Tracy Beanz"), the anonymous @catturd2 account and an Arizona man who went by the handle @prayingmedic before Twitter suspended him following the Jan. 6 insurrection.
By tracking follower counts on Twitter and Facebook, The Post found that this group rose steeply in popularity in the six months before the Jan. 6 riot, gaining a stunning 25 million followers on the two platforms. For those who already boasted massive audiences, most grew their followings by at least 50 percent by posting about election fraud. For those with more modest audiences — about 1 in 5 on the list — the payoff for sowing doubt in the election was even bigger.
Some surged in status: Becker's Twitter audience grew by more than 1,000 percent. Like him, some have turned selling outrage into a day job or lucrative side hustle, collecting ad dollars, donations and speaking fees for disseminating their views.
Most members of the 77, including Trump, either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to be interviewed. Of those who did respond, several defended their behavior online, saying they merely raised questions about complex topics worthy of public scrutiny. Some criticized the tech companies for banning users who tried to engage in public debate about controversial topics.
Pool, for example, sidestepped questions about a litany of tweets pointing out instances of election fraud. In an email exchange, he noted that he has said he believes Biden won the election and that he has repeatedly stated on his podcast "that [Trump is] wrong, that the claims are unproven, and many are easily debunked." He added: "Evidence of fraud is not proof that fraud changed the election."
Becker defended his messages online and denied knowingly spreading misinformation about the election or other topics. Via LinkedIn messages, he criticized The Post's efforts to scrutinize influencers who discuss election fraud, saying it "furthers the persistent media bias that 'right is bad' while 'left is good.' "
"I never used the words the 'election was stolen' or that 'Trump won, Biden lost' or anything like that. I highlighted articles that appeared to be evidence of election malfeasance," Becker wrote. " 'Rigging an election' can mean many things, by the way, and that includes changing laws without the proper legal channels."
The tech companies say they took action to penalize spreaders of election misinformation, especially those who promoted the insurrection. But Twitter banned only 12 of the 77 "big lie" influencers in the period around the 2020 election and the Jan. 6 riot, The Post found, including Trump. (Eight others already had been banned or were banned later.) YouTube — the only major tech company to prohibit claims that the 2020 election was rigged — banned just four of the 77, while Facebook banned only two: Trump and Bannon.
Twitter and Facebook declined to comment on The Post's findings. The companies have said they use other means, short of full bans, to penalize problematic accounts and maintain a strikes system to deal with repeat offenders.
YouTube spokeswoman Ivy Choi provided a statement: "We remove videos that spread violative 'Stop the Steal' narratives and terminate channels that receive three strikes in a 90-day period. As a result, we've removed tens of thousands of videos and terminated a number of channels for violating our Community Guidelines and Terms of Service ."
Of the 77 figures, 57 remain active on Twitter. To gauge their ongoing influence since Jan. 6, The Post measured their follower counts on Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms, along with shares and retweets of posts containing misinformation on an array of topics that have shaped the national conversation since the 2020 election.
The analysis found that the massive megaphones built by posting about election fraud have given the 57 an outsize role in pushing other false and divisive narratives. For example, members of this group wrote five of the top 20 most-shared tweets about "grooming," a homophobic meme that falsely equates teaching children about sexuality with befriending them for purposes of sexual abuse.

Members of the group also continue to seed unproven claims about election fraud, writing about a quarter of the most-retweeted posts on that topic since January 2021, The Post found. The issue continues to resonate with the public: A recent Monmouth University poll found that 29 percent of Americans say Biden won the election because of voter fraud.
After reviewing The Post's findings, Angelo Carusone, president and CEO of Media Matters for America, a liberal group that tracks right-leaning accounts, compared the soaring popularity of the 77 figures to the reshaping of the information landscape in the late 1990s, when Rush Limbaugh and other Republican cable and radio stars rose to prominence.
"What was unleashed during the 'big lie' was nothing less than the next wave of right-wing media figures, influencers, leaders and organizers," Carusone said. The "big lie" was like "a piñata bursting, and these figures were able to repurpose the candy they collected for the next big event."
Recently, many have found a powerful new topic: Elon Musk's on-again-off-again effort to acquire Twitter.

Twitter also removed more than 70,000 accounts tied to QAnon, silencing others on The Post's list, including Gateway Pundit's Hoft and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell.
Reaction to the purges was swift: Republican leaders decried "Big Tech censorship" and encouraged their supporters to switch to a growing crop of right-leaning social media services such as Gettr, Gab and Trump's struggling Truth Social. But nearly two years later, virtually all of the election fraud influencers are more active on major platforms than on any of the right-wing services, The Post found.

The new covid booster is a bit of a gamble — but one well worth taking

Full text: For all the amazing benefits of the mRNA coronavirus vaccines, there are limitations. The effectiveness wanes. New variants evolve faster than shots can be adjusted. Destructive disinformation about their safety lingers. Yet, the vaccines are critical to battling disease and death — and that also goes for the next generation of boosters coming soon. Critics might raise fresh concerns about these new shots, and there are some things the public should know. But the latest booster, as with all the previous shots, promises to be a life raft in dangerous seas.
Both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have asked the government for emergency use authorization for a bivalent booster that would be based on the earlier vaccine as well as target the now-prevalent BA.4/5 subvariants. The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are expected to give a green light in coming days. The Pfizer dose is for those 12 years and older; Moderna's for 18 and older. In both cases, before the booster, a patient must have taken the two primary doses. But the new booster will be administered to anyone who has none, one or two of the previous booster shots.
The advantage of the bivalent booster is that it has a better chance of protecting against the variant that dominates today. No one knows how much better, but experts say it could boost the levels of protection, as well as the duration and the breadth. Unfortunately, it is still a booster, and there might need to be more. Science is still chasing the goal of a pan-coronavirus vaccine that will last a long time.
What's different this time is that this booster is being rolled out before human clinical trials are complete. (The trials are getting underway.) This is a bit of a gamble that past is prologue — that the experience with billions of doses of the earlier vaccines shows they are safe and effective. Also, tests in mice show that the boosters work, and this testing method has been used often in the past with the seasonal influenza vaccine. The new boosters are already in production and might show up for consumers in September.
Waiting for full clinical trial results might leave the booster well behind the curve if the virus mutates into a new variant. The trade-off — a booster that is currently relevant, with less clinical trial data — seems reasonable. Demanding both an effective vaccine and a full clinical trial "is simply a fantasy against this rapidly changing virus," says epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina. Yet policymakers must be vigilant. They hold a fragile public trust in their hands. Already, booster uptake has been inexcusably low. The government must be totally transparent about this choice and do nothing to add to vaccine hesitancy and doubts.
The federal government has ordered 175 million doses of the bivalent booster, but this might be the last one that is free. Congress has unwisely balked at more pandemic funding. While many people have insurance that will eventually cover vaccine costs, those without insurance or means might give up on the vaccine life raft altogether. That would be an unnecessary and avoidable tragedy.

Full text: As Congress returns this week, it should quickly address the unfinished business of global pandemic vaccination coverage, which is losing momentum. Some $5 billion was omitted from the most recent covid-19 funding bill in a political compromise. But there can be no compromising with this virus. It must be fought in many lower-income countries, where vaccine uptake is low, to reduce the chances of another destructive variant.
The vaccine rollout has been lopsided for more than a year. All told, 11.5 billion doses have been administered worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, high-income countries, with a population of 1.17 billion, and upper-middle-income countries, 2.6 billion people, have achieved 74 percent uptake of those primary doses, but the lower-middle-income countries, or 3.3 billion people, have achieved only 51 percent coverage, and in the lower-income countries, 665 million people, the uptake is only 11 percent. The target of immunizing 70 percent of the population has been met by only 52 of the 194 member states of the WHO. Not a single lower-income country and only three of the 54 lower-middle-income countries have reached the goal. Many of the poorest countries are below 10 percent. Of the WHO members in the African region, more than half decreased their vaccination rate in the month that ended April 11.
At the early stages of the vaccine rollout, supply was the main bottleneck, and many poorer nations chafed at being left behind. Over the long run, it is vital that manufacturing capacity be expanded to permanently serve these nations and right the balance in vaccine distribution for future crises. At this point in the pandemic, however, supplies have caught up. The Serum Institute of India, a key supplier to developing countries, stopped making fresh batches after its stockpile grew to 200 million doses. Some organizations, including the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have asked the world to pause and better stagger vaccine delivery.
The problem now is on the demand side — to overcome logistical hurdles and vaccine hesitancy to get more shots from airports into arms, especially among at-risk populations, including the elderly, and health-care workers. This can be difficult; many countries do not have resources to create campaigns to promote vaccines, and publics, faced with misinformation and disinformation, don't know whom to trust. Another factor is that other diseases, from measles to malaria, remain pressing threats in some areas and are competing with coronavirus vaccines for scarce resources. According to the Biden administration, efforts by the U.S. Agency for International Development to help surge support for vaccination to the neediest countries will be curtailed if Congress does not act.
In this period of relatively low infections in the United States, it can be easy to slip into complacency. But the virus never stops evolving. All the major variants have originated outside the United States. The best way to avert a new one arising — and causing us more pain and misery — is to vaccinate as many people as possible around the world, as soon as possible.

Full text: Dr. Robert Malone says he helped invent mRNA vaccines and has been wronged for decades. Now he’s spreading unfounded claims about the vaccines and the virus.
MADISON, Va. — “I haven’t been able to ride a horse in months,” Dr. Robert Malone said from his 50-acre horse farm about two hours southwest of Washington. “It’s just a constant barrage of requests for assistance.”
Dr. Malone, 62, was sitting barefoot at his kitchen table, wearing a navy tie decorated with dark red spikes of the coronavirus, in the middle of another busy day of appearances on conservative television shows and podcasts. Just that week, he had appeared on “Hannity,” a hit on Fox News that averages over three million viewers, and on One America News. He joined “Candace,” an online talk show hosted by the right-wing media personality Candace Owens. And he was a guest on the podcasts “America First With Sebastian Gorka” and “The Joe Pags Show.”
Dr. Malone spent decades working in academic centers and with start-ups seeking to bring new medical treatments to market and to combat the Zika and Ebola outbreaks. But in recent months, as the coronavirus pandemic has persisted, he has taken up an entirely different role: spreading misinformation about the virus and vaccines on conservative programs.
In many of his appearances, Dr. Malone questions the severity of the coronavirus, which has now killed nearly one million people in the United States, and the safety of the coronavirus vaccines, which have been widely found to be safe and effective at preventing serious illness and death. His statements in late December on “The Joe Rogan Experience,” one of the most popular podcasts in the country, with 11 million listeners per episode on average, were at the center of the uproar over Mr. Rogan’s role in spreading bad information about the virus.
Dr. Malone also routinely sells himself on the shows as the inventor of mRNA vaccines, the technology used by Pfizer and Moderna for their Covid-19 shots, and says he doesn’t get the credit he deserves for their development. While he was involved in some early research into the technology, his role in its creation was minimal at best, say half a dozen Covid experts and researchers, including three who worked closely with Dr. Malone.
In spreading these exaggerations and unfounded claims, Dr. Malone joins medical professionals and scientists, like Dr. Joseph Mercola and Dr. Judy Mikovits, whose profiles have grown during the pandemic as they spread misinformation about mask-wearing and convoluted conspiracy theories about virus experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci.
But unlike many of them, Dr. Malone is quite new to the right-wing media world, first appearing regularly on podcasts last June. Even two years into the pandemic, new misinformation stars are being minted. And in today’s media echo chamber — powered by social media algorithms and a tightknit network of politicians and influencers promoting debunked claims — they can quickly catapult to stardom.
In addition to his regular appearances on conservative shows, Dr. Malone has more than 134,000 subscribers to his Substack newsletter. About 8,000 pay the $5 monthly cost, he said, which would amount to at least $31,200 in monthly revenue. And mentions of him on social media, on cable television and in print and online news outlets have soared — to more than 300,000 so far this year, according to Zignal, a media research firm.
The coronavirus pandemic has “given rise to a class of influencers who build conspiracy theories and recruit as many people into them as possible,” said Emerson T. Brooking, a resident senior fellow for the Atlantic Council who studies digital platforms. “These influencers usually have a special claim to expertise and a veneer of credibility.”
“And almost without exception, these influencers feel that they have been wronged by mainstream society in some way,” Mr. Brooking added.
Dr. Malone earned a medical degree from Northwestern University in 1991, and for the next decade taught pathology at the University of California, Davis, and the University of Maryland. He then turned to biotech start-ups and consulting. His résumé says he was “instrumental” in securing early-stage approval for research on the Ebola vaccine by the pharmaceutical company Merck in the mid-2010s. He also worked on repurposing drugs to treat Zika.
In extended interviews at his home over two days, Dr. Malone said he was repeatedly not recognized for his contributions over the course of his career, his voice low and grave as he recounted perceived slights by the institutions he had worked for. His wife, Dr. Jill Glasspool Malone, paced the room and pulled up articles on her laptop that she said supported his complaints.
The example he points to more frequently is from his time at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego. While there, he performed experiments that showed how human cells could absorb an mRNA cocktail and produce proteins from it. Those experiments, he says, make him the inventor of mRNA vaccine technology.
“I was there,” Dr. Malone said. “I wrote all the invention.”
What the mainstream media did instead, he said, was give credit for the mRNA vaccines to the scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman, because there “is a concerted campaign to get them the Nobel Prize” by Pfizer and BioNTech, where Dr. Kariko is a senior vice president, as well as the University of Pennsylvania, where Dr. Weissman leads a laboratory researching vaccines and infectious diseases.
But at the time he was conducting those experiments, it was not known how to protect the fragile RNA from the immune system’s attack, scientists say. Former colleagues said they had watched in astonishment as Dr. Malone began posting on social media about why he deserved to win the Nobel Prize.
The idea that he is the inventor of mRNA vaccines is “a totally false claim,” said Dr. Gyula Acsadi, a pediatrician in Connecticut who along with Dr. Malone and five others wrote a widely cited paper in 1990 showing that injecting RNA into muscle could produce proteins. (The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines work by injecting RNA into arm muscles that produce copies of the “spike protein” found on the outside of the coronavirus. The human immune system identifies that protein, attacks it and then remembers how to defeat it.)
But Dr. Malone was not the lead author on the paper and, according to Dr. Acsadi, did not make a significant contribution to the research. While the paper stated that the technology could “provide alternative approaches to vaccine development,” Dr. Acsadi said none of the other authors would claim that they invented the vaccine.
“Some of his work was important,” said Dr. Alastair McAlpine, a pediatric infectious disease doctor based in Vancouver, British Columbia, “but that’s a long way away from claiming to have invented the technology that underpins the vaccines as we use them today.”
The vaccines “are the result of hundreds of scientists all over the world, all combining to come together to form this vaccine,” Dr. McAlpine said. “It was not one individual or the pioneering work of an individual person.”
A spokeswoman for Penn Medicine said, “We have been excited to witness the deployment of the vaccines in the global fight against the virus and the well-deserved global recognition for Drs. Kariko and Weissman’s decades of visionary basic science research.”
Dr. Malone pushes back against the criticism directed at him by scientists, researchers and journalists, and dismisses the dozens of fact-checks disputing his statements as “attacks.”
He also continues to repeat his claims, with the help of his wife, Dr. Glasspool Malone, who is trained in biotechnology and public policy. She writes, he said, more than half of the articles posted onto his Substack newsletter — which is awash in conspiracy theories about the Covid-19 vaccines. Recent articles include “The illusion of evidence-based medicine” and “How does it feel to be vindicated?”
Dr. Malone said he did not align himself with any particular political party. But in recent months, he and his wife have made numerous stops at popular conservative conferences, like Hereticon, the Peter Thiel-backed conference in Miami for Silicon Valley’s self-proclaimed contrarians, and the “Defeat the Mandates” march in Washington.
Dr. Malone says much of the pushback he receives is because anything that questions the guidance from organizations like the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is automatically labeled misinformation by the medical establishment, as well as the technology platforms.
Many well-meaning public figures and donors committed themselves to the wrong ideas, just to be able to tell themselves that they are indeed playing a role helping to solve the crisis, he said.
“It is really easy to get caught up in it, and obsess, and lose perspective — and kind of lose yourself,” Dr. Malone said of them.
Many scientists and researchers say there is good-faith disagreement about how to translate fast-moving science into policy, and acknowledge that health agencies have adjusted guidelines over time, as new information is collected.
Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan, said such guidance was “only as reliable as the evidence behind it, and thus it should change when new evidence is obtained.”
But they say Dr. Malone has twisted legitimate policy debates to use them as cover for continuing to spread misinformation and to advance claims about the pandemic that are demonstrably incorrect.
Months ago, he was promoting the drugs hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin for treatment of Covid-19, despite several studies and scientific trials showing a lack of evidence that the drugs improved the conditions of Covid patients. Dr. Malone said that early on in the pandemic, he believed that what he could contribute was bringing repurposed drugs to market.
“All the big boys came in for the vaccines,” Dr. Malone said. “We weren’t needed for that.”
The Food and Drug Administration continues to caution against the use of hydroxychloroquine “due to risk of heart rhythm problems,” and a large study published in March found that ivermectin does not reduce the risk of Covid hospitalization. The F.D.A. has also said taking large doses of the drug is dangerous.
“Robert Malone is exploiting the fact that data-driven course correction is inherent to the scientific process to peddle disinformation,” Dr. Rasmussen said. “It’s extraordinarily dishonest and morally bankrupt.”

Full text: New York City officials began holding vaccine clinics at elementary schools this week in hopes of improving rates among children, as coronavirus cases start to head back up.
Andrew Melville's daughter is in the fourth grade at P.S. 69 Journey Prep School in the Bronx, where 22 percent of students are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. While Mr. Melville has gotten vaccinated himself, he does not believe his daughter should do so because he has concerns about the effectiveness of the shots.
"I'm against it 100 percent for kids," Mr. Melville, 32, said. "You still could catch Covid with it. I caught Covid twice, and I'm fully vaccinated and got the booster shot."
Resistance among parents like Mr. Melville is one of the reasons that vaccination rates for New York City's 1 million public school students significantly lag those for adults. Some health experts find the figures alarming, in part because the city recently lifted its school mask mandate, along with other pandemic restrictions. And coronavirus case rates have begun to rise again, driven largely by BA.2, a highly transmissible Omicron subvariant.
Cases increased 31 percent in New York City in the past two weeks as of Thursday, according to The New York Times's tracker. Case counts at schools are on the rise too, with 227 reported on Wednesday compared with 206 one week ago. The increase in cases at schools in the seven-day period that ended on Tuesday marked the biggest weekly gain since the peak of the Omicron wave, according to an analysis from The City.
In an effort to reverse the trend and bolster inoculations among children ages 5 to 11, New York City officials began holding vaccine clinics this week at public elementary schools in every borough except Manhattan, which has the highest vaccination rate among students. The weeklong clinics will be held at a new set of 20 schools each week, chosen based on their size and their vaccination rates, according to a spokesman for the New York City Education Department.
A total of 75 students were vaccinated at the clinics on Monday and Tuesday, the spokesman said. The clinics will return to the schools in several weeks to administer second doses.
The city mounted a broader effort at all elementary schools over the course of five weeks last fall, and nearly 60,000 students and staff members were vaccinated during that push. After the five weeks were up, in mid-December, around 27 percent of all vaccinated students in the 5-to-11 age group had received their shots at school.
The hope is that the clinics this time around will reach students whose parents have, until now, been hesitant or resistant, said Dr. Wayne J. Riley, the president of SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University and a co-chairman of Mayor Eric Adams's health-equity task force.
"I think now, parents can clearly see that the vaccines work to forestall the worst effects of Covid," Dr. Riley said, adding that it was important to continue getting information about the vaccines out to families.
While the clinics will help certain parents by making vaccines easier to access, they may not be enough to convince others, who have not been persuaded about the safety and efficacy of the shots and who in some cases have absorbed misinformation about them. One surefire way to improve vaccination rates would be to mandate the shots, some experts said.
"I think clinics will help, it helps remove the logistical barriers, but they only get the vaccination rates so far," said Dr. Denis Nash, an epidemiologist at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy.
"I would imagine that to get the vaccination coverage up there for kids, vaccine requirements would be the way to do it," he added.
While more than 87 percent of adults and 79 percent of children ages 13 to 17 in New York City are fully vaccinated, according to city data, the same is true for just about 45 percent of those ages 5 to 12. (The national vaccination rate for children ages 5 to 12 is even lower, at 27 percent, according to The New York Times's database.)
White children ages 5 to 17 have the lowest vaccination rate in the city: Forty percent are fully vaccinated, compared to 43 percent of Black children, 54 percent of Latino children and 99 percent of Asian children, according to city data.
The city has required teachers and school staff to be vaccinated, but there is no such requirement for students. Early this month the Supreme Court rejected the latest effort by New York City teachers to challenge the vaccine mandate.
The city's new health commissioner, Dr. Ashwin Vasan, said on Tuesday that he was weighing a vaccine mandate for public school students. He said that vaccination rates for 5- to 11-year-olds, the most recent age group to become eligible for the shots, were too low and that health and education officials were working to raise them.
"I think we've seen time and again, mandates are an important tool to getting vaccination levels up," Dr. Vasan said at a news conference with the mayor at City Hall.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was authorized late last year for emergency use in children 5 to 11. While recent data collected by health officials in New York State shows that it is less effective in preventing infections in those children than in older ones, it is still quite effective at preventing hospitalization.
No vaccine has yet been authorized for children under 5, though Pfizer plans to release results in April from a three-shot study for that age group. And Moderna said on Wednesday that it would seek emergency authorization for the use of its vaccine in children younger than 6.
Some students are attending schools where vaccination rates are quite low. At majority-Black schools, 35 percent of students are vaccinated, according to a Chalkbeat analysis conducted this month. At schools where most students are Latino, 44 percent are vaccinated, the analysis showed, compared with 51 percent at majority-white schools and 64 percent at majority-Asian schools.
Children are generally at a lower risk of a bad outcome if they get Covid-19, though some do get seriously ill from the virus. Those who get infected can also pass the virus on to others who are more vulnerable, Dr. Nash noted.
"All of these kids are connected to households and families and communities around the city," Dr. Nash said. "It is important, in my view, to increase vaccination among kids to protect them but also to limit the spread."
Children remain unvaccinated for a number of reasons. Some parents say they simply haven't had the time to get their children vaccinated. Others don't trust the safety of the shots. And some children have legitimate medical reasons for avoiding the vaccines.
Tyasia Baptistte's son is in the third grade at P.S. 40 George W. Carver Elementary School in Brooklyn, where just 19.2 percent of students are fully vaccinated, according to city data. Ms. Baptistte, 23, is vaccinated, but she said she wanted more information before her son gets the vaccine.
"The doctors have been telling me to hold on because he was sick," Ms. Baptistte said, adding that her son had a lung problem. "My mom works in a hospital, so I'm not close-minded. I just want to make sure that we're making the right decision for our little babies."
Chasity Arias's children are in the fourth and fifth grade at P.S. 96 Richard Rodgers Elementary School in the Bronx, where 20.6 percent of students are fully vaccinated, according to city data. Ms. Arias, 31, is not vaccinated, and does not plan to get her children vaccinated either.
"First I will have to see if I think it's safe for me, and then once I receive it, and I feel that it's safe for me, then maybe I'll think about getting it for my kids," Ms. Arias said.
The coronavirus vaccines are safe, and few adverse effects have been reported. The vaccines have also been effective at preventing hospitalization and death from Covid-19.
But many families, who may not be tracking the latest research from the medical community, still have questions about how exactly the shots work. And many communities have been inundated with misinformation and disinformation about the vaccines.
"No parent ever wants to feel like they're doing something to harm their child," said Dr. Toni Eyssallenne, an internist and pediatrician for Strong Children's Wellness, a Queens-based medical group.
"We have to do a better job of trying to stave the misinformation and making sure that we're making it easy access, that we're having patient conversations with our parents, to make sure that everybody feels secure and safe," she said.
The concerns expressed by Cynthia Nieves, an unvaccinated mother of two, illustrate why vaccine hesitancy is a lingering problem.
One of her children attends P.S. 96 and is eligible to get vaccinated, but Ms. Nieves said no amount of information at a pop-up clinic would convince her.
"It's just something I still don't believe in yet," she said. "I don't want to give them something and later on, years down the line, something happens to my kids, because then I would feel like it's my fault."

NEW YORK — Andrew Melville’s daughter is in the fourth grade at Public School 69 Journey Prep in the Bronx, where 22% of students are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. While Melville has gotten vaccinated himself, he does not believe his daughter should do so because he has concerns about the effectiveness of the shots.
“I’m against it 100% for kids,” Melville, 32, said. “You still could catch COVID with it. I caught COVID twice, and I’m fully vaccinated and got the booster shot.”
Resistance among parents like Melville is one of the reasons that vaccination rates for New York City’s 1 million public school students significantly lag those for adults. Some health experts find the figures alarming, in part because the city recently lifted its school mask mandate, along with other pandemic restrictions. And coronavirus case rates have begun to creep upward again, driven largely by BA.2, a highly transmissible omicron subvariant.
In an effort to bolster inoculations among children ages 5-11, New York City officials began holding vaccine clinics this week at public elementary schools in every borough except Manhattan, which has the highest vaccination rate among students. The weeklong clinics will be held at a new set of 20 schools each week, chosen based on their size and their vaccination rates, according to a spokesperson for the New York City Education Department.
A total of 75 students were vaccinated at the clinics Monday and Tuesday, the spokesperson said. The clinics will return to the schools in several weeks to administer second doses.
The city mounted a broader effort at all elementary schools over the course of five weeks last fall, and nearly 60,000 students and staff members were vaccinated during that push. After the five weeks were up, in mid-December, around 27% of all vaccinated students in the 5-11 age group had received their shots at school.
The hope is that the clinics this time around will reach students whose parents have, until now, been hesitant or resistant, said Dr. Wayne Riley, the president of SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University and a co-chair of Mayor Eric Adams' health-equity task force.
“I think now, parents can clearly see that the vaccines work to forestall the worst effects of COVID,” Riley said, adding that it was important to continue getting information about the vaccines out to families.
While the clinics will help certain parents by making vaccines easier to access, they may not be enough to convince others, who have not been persuaded about the safety and efficacy of the shots and who in some cases have absorbed misinformation about them. One surefire way to improve vaccination rates would be to mandate the shots, some experts said.
“I think clinics will help, it helps remove the logistical barriers, but they only get the vaccination rates so far,” said Dr. Denis Nash, a public health researcher at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy.
“I would imagine that to get the vaccination coverage up there for kids, vaccine requirements would be the way to do it,” he added.
While more than 87% of adults and 79% of children ages 13-17 in New York City are fully vaccinated, according to city data, the same is true for just about 45% of those ages 5-12. (The national vaccination rate for children ages 5-12 is even lower, at 27%, according to The New York Times' database.)
White children ages 5-17 have the lowest vaccination rate in the city: Forty percent are fully vaccinated, compared with 43% of Black children, 54% of Latino children and 99% of Asian children, according to city data.
The city has required teachers and school staff to be vaccinated, but there is no such requirement for students. Early this month the Supreme Court rejected the latest effort by New York City teachers to challenge the vaccine mandate.
The city’s new health commissioner, Dr. Ashwin Vasan, said Tuesday that he was weighing a vaccine mandate for public school students. He said that vaccination rates for 5- to 11-year-olds, the most recent age group to become eligible for the shots, were too low and that health and education officials were working to raise them.
“I think we’ve seen time and again, mandates are an important tool to getting vaccination levels up,” Vasan said at a news conference with the mayor at City Hall.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was authorized late last year for emergency use in children ages 5-11. While recent data collected by health officials in New York state shows that it is less effective in preventing infections in those children than in older ones, it is still quite effective at preventing hospitalization.
No vaccine has yet been authorized for children younger than 5, though Pfizer plans to release results in April from a three-shot study for that age group. And Moderna said Wednesday that it would seek emergency authorization for the use of its vaccine in children younger than 6.
Coronavirus cases increased 47% in New York City in the past two weeks as of Tuesday, according to The New York Times' tracker. Case counts at schools are on the rise, too, with 304 reported Tuesday compared with 206 nearly one week ago.
Some students are attending schools where vaccination rates are quite low. At majority-Black schools, 35% of students are vaccinated, according to a Chalkbeat analysis conducted this month. At schools where most students are Latino, 44% are vaccinated, the analysis showed, compared with 51% at majority-white schools and 64% at majority-Asian schools.
Children are generally at a lower risk of a bad outcome if they get COVID-19, though some do get seriously ill from the virus. Those who get infected can also pass the virus on to others who are more vulnerable, Nash noted.
“All of these kids are connected to households and families and communities around the city,” Nash said. “It is important, in my view, to increase vaccination among kids to protect them but also to limit the spread.”
Children remain unvaccinated for a number of reasons. Some parents say they simply haven’t had the time to get their children vaccinated. Others don’t trust the safety of the shots. And some children have legitimate medical reasons for avoiding the vaccines.
Tyasia Baptistte’s son is in the third grade at Public School 40 George W. Carver Elementary in Brooklyn, where just 19.2% of students are fully vaccinated, according to city data. Baptistte, 23, is vaccinated, but she said she wanted more information before her son gets the vaccine.
“The doctors have been telling me to hold on because he was sick,” Baptistte said, adding that her son had a lung problem. “My mom works in a hospital, so I’m not close-minded. I just want to make sure that we’re making the right decision for our little babies.”
Chasity Arias' children are in the fourth and fifth grade at Public School 96 Richard Rodgers Elementary in the Bronx, where 20.6% of students are fully vaccinated, according to city data. Arias, 31, is not vaccinated, and does not plan to get her children vaccinated either.
“First I will have to see if I think it’s safe for me, and then once I receive it, and I feel that it’s safe for me, then maybe I’ll think about getting it for my kids,” Arias said.
The coronavirus vaccines are safe, and few adverse effects have been reported. The vaccines have also been effective at preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19.
But many families, who may not be tracking the latest research from the medical community, still have questions about how exactly the shots work. And many communities have been inundated with misinformation and disinformation about the vaccines.
“No parent ever wants to feel like they’re doing something to harm their child,” said Dr. Toni Eyssallenne, an internist and pediatrician for Strong Children’s Wellness, a Queens-based medical group.
“We have to do a better job of trying to stave the misinformation and making sure that we’re making it easy access, that we’re having patient conversations with our parents, to make sure that everybody feels secure and safe,” she said.
The concerns expressed by Cynthia Nieves, an unvaccinated mother of two, illustrate why vaccine hesitancy is a lingering problem.
One of her children attends PS 96 and is eligible to get vaccinated, but Nieves said no amount of information at a pop-up clinic would convince her.
“It’s just something I still don’t believe in yet,” she said. “I don’t want to give them something and later on, years down the line, something happens to my kids, because then I would feel like it’s my fault.”

Full text: This is the latest installment of a weekly feature I have been running for some time on this blog — lessons from the nonprofit News Literacy Project, which aims to teach students and the public how to sort fact from fiction in our digital and contentious age.
The News Literacy Project was founded more than a decade ago by Alan Miller, formerly a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter at the Los Angeles Times, and it has become the leading provider of news literacy education. You can learn more about the organization and its resources and programs in this piece.
The material in this post comes from the organization's newsletter for educators, the Sift, which has more than 23,000 subscribers. Published weekly during the school year, it explores timely examples of misinformation, addresses media and press freedom topics, discusses social media trends and issues, and includes discussion prompts and activities for the classroom. Get Smart About News, modeled on the Sift, is a free weekly newsletter for the general public.
The News Literacy Project's browser-based e-learning platform Checkology helps educators teach middle and high school students how to identify credible information, seek out reliable sources, and know what to trust, what to dismiss and what to debunk.
It also gives them an appreciation of the importance of the First Amendment and a free press. Checkology and all of NLP's resources and programs are free. Since 2016, more than 37,000 educators in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and more than 120 other countries have registered to use the platform. Since August 2020, more than 3,000 educators and more than 125,000 students have actively used Checkology.

Top picks
1. Vaccine deniers are embracing Robert Malone , an infectious-disease researcher who pushes widely discredited claims about coronavirus vaccines, as a credentialed voice who affirms their distrust of the overwhelming scientific consensus about the pandemic. Malone — who in the late 1980s made a discovery that contributed to research on mRNA vaccines — was catapulted into the public eye after he was featured on "The Joe Rogan Experience" podcast in December.
Discuss: Why has Malone gained such prominence among vaccine deniers? What role do Malone's credentials play in his popularity among this group? What do other experts with Malone's credentials say about his claims? What does it take for consensus to emerge among scientists?

Dig deeper: Use this think sheet to further explore the impact Malone has had on misinformation about covid-19 and the coronavirus vaccines.
2. Russia has been pushing disinformation about Ukraine since 2014, but American intelligence officials and other experts told the New York Times that they've seen an increase in false propaganda narratives in recent months. Russia is also trying to use information influence operations to exacerbate social divisions in Ukraine — similar to its efforts to polarize American voters in 2016.
Idea: Divide students into groups and assign each group one theme from this fact sheet on top Russian disinformation narratives. Then, discuss: How do these narratives seek to provoke or manipulate people's emotions? Why is propaganda often designed to divide or polarize people?

3. Children's media and news programs have faced a tough task in covering the pandemic and explaining it to a young audience. But they've done so with "a level of clarity and directness in their pandemic coverage that can be hard to find" in news sources for more adult audiences, writes Kate Cray of the Atlantic. "Sesame Street," for instance, teamed up with CNN to tackle coronavirus vaccine questions after officials recommended the shot for children ages 5 to 11. Kids' media, Cray notes, shines for being straightforward, offering ample context and answering questions authentic to its audience.
Idea: Examine several of the kids' news stories and segments cited in the Atlantic piece. How do they approach the news? Compare these stories with news coverage for older audiences. Consider factors such as word choice, context and tone. How does kids' news take into account "children's specific news needs"? Does this coverage still aspire to journalism standards?
Another idea: Ask students to find a recent news report on an issue they care about. How would they repackage or rework this coverage for younger audiences?
Viral rumor rundown
No, this "amazing" perpetual motion sculpture isn't real
NO: The "sculpture" in this video is not real.
YES: It is a 3D animation created by the digital artist Andreas Wannerstedt, who is known for creating perfectly synchronized animations.
YES: Engagement bait accounts — or accounts that share "amazing" content optimized to go viral — frequently share digital art out of context.
YES: Other pieces of Wannerstedt's digital art have also been presented out of context by similar accounts.
NewsLit takeaway: Photos and video purporting to capture "amazing" aspects of the natural world — everything from supposedly cute or unusual animals and stunning (but fake) space photos to incredible (and nonexistent) geological formations and feats of physics — often go viral. After all, how tempting is it to "like" a video of fast tortoises or other seemingly incredible aspects of nature? But be aware that these types of photos and videos are commonly used as "engagement bait" by accounts seeking to build up large social media audiences.

Full text: Joseph Mercola, a leading anti-vaccine advocate whose screeds have been restricted by YouTube and Facebook, this month warned that the unvaccinated might soon be imprisoned in government-run camps. The week before, he circulated a study purporting to use government data to prove that more children had died of covid shots than from the coronavirus itself.
Shut down by major social media platforms, Mercola has found a new way to spread these debunked claims: on Substack, the subscription-based newsletter platform that is increasingly a hub for controversial and often misleading perspectives about the coronavirus.
Substack, which researchers from the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate say makes millions of dollars off anti-vaccine misinformation, on Wednesday defended its tolerance for publishing "writers with whom we strongly disagree."
Prominent figures known for spreading misinformation, such as Mercola, have flocked to Substack, podcasting platforms and a growing number of right-wing social media networks over the past year after getting kicked off or restricted on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.
Now these alternative platforms are beginning to face some of the scrutiny that has imperiled social media services. But there's a fundamental difference in the architecture of newsletters and podcasts when compared to that of social media companies. Social networks use algorithms to spread content — sometimes misinformation — to users who don't want to see it. Newsletters and podcasts don't.
These newer platforms cater to subscribers who seek out specific content that accommodates their viewpoints — potentially making the services less responsible for spreading harmful views, some misinformation experts say. At the same time, the platforms are exposing tens of thousands of people to misinformation each month — content that can potentially lead people to engage in behaviors that endanger themselves and others.
Earlier this month, 250 doctors and scientists wrote an open letter to the music streaming platform Spotify asking the company to drop host and comedian Joe Rogan — one of its most popular podcasters — for discussing conspiracy theories about vaccines. Neil Young asked the company to remove his music in protest this week, saying in a letter that Spotify "can have Rogan or Young. But not both." (Spotify dropped Young on Wednesday.) Former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon, who was booted from Spotify in 2020, used his popular podcast, available on multiple platforms, to disseminate violent rhetoric and false claims about the election in the weeks leading up to the Capitol siege on Jan. 6.
Substack, which was founded in San Francisco in 2017, is part of a growing crop of subscription-based services whose mission is to help creators, authors and other influencers get paid for building more intimate relationships with devoted audiences. Readers pay per month to subscribe to a certain author, and the author keeps 90 percent of the revenue, while Substack takes 10 percent. The subscription model has become so popular that Twitter recently launched a subscription service and Facebook has outlined plans for paid subscription-based newsletters for authors and creators.
Mercola has been banned from YouTube, and his content has been restricted on Facebook. He uses his remaining public channels — like Twitter — to direct people to a "Censored Library" of articles he publishes in his newsletter, which is one of the top 20 most popular political newsletters on Substack.
Mercola did not respond to a request for comment.
This type of content is "so bad no one else will host it," said Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit that focuses on combating misinformation and has researched Substack. By splitting subscription profits with creators, the group estimates, Substack generates at least $2.5 million a year in revenue from just five anti-vaccine leaders who have amassed tens of thousands of subscribers, each paying $50 a year.
Substack declined to comment, but shortly after The Washington Post made inquiries, CEO Chris Best and his two co-founders published a blog post saying that putting up with "the presence of writers with whom we strongly disagree" was a "necessary precondition for creating more trust in the information ecosystem as a whole."
"The more that powerful institutions attempt to control what can and cannot be said in public, the more people there will be who are ready to create alternative narratives about what's 'true,' spurred by a belief that there's a conspiracy to suppress important information," they wrote.
Facebook groups and other closed forums have long been plagued with misinformation because they are essentially echo chambers in which users share similar viewpoints, experts say, and newsletters face similar problems. They can make like-minded people more radicalized in their beliefs. And a popular newsletter can be picked up and amplified by other outlets, as well as forwarded to others.
Early on, social media companies took a hands-off approach to policing content. Only posts directly advocating violence or lawbreaking were removed. But Silicon Valley firms like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have changed their approach over the past four years in response to controversies, including the use of their services for online bullying and sowing disinformation. They have crafted policies that police many forms of harmful material, including banning misinformation about the coronavirus, and have hired small armies of moderators who scan content and delete what breaks the rules. They also work with fact-checkers that help the companies label content that is inaccurate.
The rules social media companies have designed for advertising are even stricter because companies do not want to be perceived as profiting off hate and other social ills.
Still, misinformation creeps through and proliferates.
Substack, by contrast, is operating under standards that resemble those of social media companies in their early days. Chief executive Best said he wants to build a platform for "questioning conventional wisdom," where "dissent is allowed." He said he disagrees with the way social media companies have been pushed into becoming "censorship police."
Best has even made a point of contrasting his business model with that of social media companies, saying the purpose of firms like Substack is to let people "take back" their minds from their social media feeds, which he refers to as "amplification machines."
Substack's limited content guidelines say the company bans "harmful content" but don't specify except to say that this includes "material that advocates, threatens, or shows you causing harm to yourself, other people, or animals." The company did not respond to questions about how the rules are being enforced, other than to say it maintains a hands-off approach.
Joan Donovan, research director of the Technology and Social Change Project at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, said the attitude of companies like Substack was only going to invite further scrutiny.
"Openness is easily exploited, so a lack of policy means the brand's reputation will be dragged anytime there is a major scandal," she said. "Substack's brand will be tied to its most controversial creators. Clear policy will ensure they can enforce their terms early on before a creator has caused so much damage that it's impossible to separate bad actors from a bad product."
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said approved coronavirus vaccines are effective in preventing covid hospitalizations and deaths. Mercola's claim that they've killed more children than covid has been debunked by PolitiFact, which cited the CDC as saying there is no clear evidence that the vaccines have caused any deaths. The claim about potentially putting the unvaccinated in prison camps is a misleading reference to a New York bill from 2015 that relates to Ebola, not the coronavirus, according to Reuters.
The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) calculated its minimum profit figure for Substack by looking at five authors who are known anti-vaccine advocates or have expressed skeptical opinions about vaccines.
Substack does not publish exact subscriber numbers but says whether authors count subscribers in the thousands and tens of thousands. The CCDH took those rough subscriber numbers and calculated their monthly profits by using low-end estimates for how much revenue is generated per subscriber. It then calculated Substack's revenue using the 90-10 split, with 90 percent of revenue going to the author and 10 percent to Substack.
"Substack should immediately stop profiting from medical misinformation that can seriously harm readers," said Ahmed, the CCDH chief.

Full text: Over 10,000 daily attacks before Jan. 6
Company downplays role in fueling violence at Capitol Facebook groups swelled with at least 650,000 posts attacking the legitimacy of Joe Biden's victory between Election Day and the Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol, with many calling for executions or other political violence, an investigation by ProPublica and The Washington Post has found.
The barrage - averaging at least 10,000 posts a day, a scale not reported previously - turned the groups into incubators for the baseless claims supporters of President Donald Trump voiced as they stormed the Capitol, demanding he get a second term. Many posts portrayed Biden's election as the result of widespread fraud that required extraordinary action - including the use of force - to prevent the nation from falling into the hands of traitors.
"LOOKS LIKE CIVIL WAR is BECOMING INEVITABLE !!!" read a post a month before the Capitol assault. "WE CANNOT ALLOW FRAUDULENT ELECTIONS TO STAND ! SILENT NO MORE MAJORITY MUST RISE UP NOW AND DEMAND BATTLEGROUND STATES NOT TO CERTIFY FRAUDULENT ELECTIONS NOW !"
Another post, made 10 days after the 2020 election, bore an avatar of a smiling woman with her arms raised in apparent triumph and read, "WE ARE AMERICANS!!! WE FOUGHT AND DIED TO START OUR COUNTRY! WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT... FIGHT LIKE HELL. WE WILL SAVE HER THEN WERE GOING TO SHOOT THE TRAITORS!!!!!!!!!!!"
One post showed a Civil War-era picture of a gallows with more than two dozen nooses and hooded figures waiting to be hanged. Other posts called for arrests and executions of specific public figures - both Democrats and Republicans - depicted as betraying the nation by denying Trump a second term.
"BILL BARR WE WILL BE COMING FOR YOU," wrote a group member after Barr announced that the Justice Department had found little evidence to support Trump's claims of widespread vote-rigging. "WE WILL HAVE CIVIL WAR IN THE STREETS BEFORE BIDEN WILL BE PRES."
Facebook executives have played down the company's role in the Jan. 6 attack and have resisted calls, including from its own Oversight Board, for a comprehensive internal investigation. The company also has yet to turn over all the information requested by the congressional committee studying the Jan. 6 attack, though it says it is negotiating with the committee.
But the ProPublica-Post investigation, which analyzed millions of posts between Election Day and Jan. 6 and drew on internal company documents and interviews with former employees, provides the clearest evidence yet that Facebook played a critical role in the spread of false narratives that fomented the violence of Jan. 6.
Its efforts to police such content, the investigation also found, were ineffective and started too late to quell the surge of angry, hateful misinformation coursing through Facebook groups - some of it explicitly calling for violent confrontation with government officials, a theme that foreshadowed the storming of the Capitol that day amid clashes that left five people dead.
Drew Pusateri, a spokesman for Meta, Facebook's newly renamed parent company, said that the platform was not responsible for the violence on Jan. 6. He pointed instead to Trump and others who voiced the lies that sparked the attack on the Capitol.
"The notion that the January 6 insurrection would not have happened but for Facebook is absurd," Pusateri said in a statement. "The former President of the United States pushed a narrative that the election was stolen, including in-person a short distance from the Capitol building that day. The responsibility for the violence that occurred on January 6 lies with those who attacked our Capitol and those who encouraged them."
To determine the extent of posts attacking Biden's victory, The Post and ProPublica obtained a unique dataset of 100,000 groups and their posts, along with metadata and images, compiled by CounterAction, a firm that studies online disinformation. The Post and ProPublica used machine learning to narrow that list to 27,000 public groups that showed clear markers of focusing on U.S. politics. Out of the more than 18 million posts in those groups between Election Day and Jan. 6, the analysis searched for words and phrases to identify attacks on the election's integrity.
The more than 650,000 posts attacking the election - and the 10,000-a-day average - is almost certainly an undercount. The ProPublica-Washington Post analysis examined posts in only a portion of all public groups, and did not include comments, posts in private groups or posts on individuals' profiles. Only Facebook has access to all the data to calculate the true total - and it hasn't done so publicly.
Facebook has heavily promoted groups since CEO Mark Zuckerberg made them a strategic priority in 2017. But the ones focused on U.S. politics have become so toxic, say former Facebook employees, that the company established a task force, whose existence has not been previously reported, specifically to police them ahead of Election Day 2020.
The task force removed hundreds of groups with violent or hateful content in the months before Nov. 3, 2020, according to the ProPublica-Post investigation.
Yet shortly after the vote, Facebook dissolved the task force and rolled back other intensive enforcement measures. The results of that decision were clear in the data ProPublica and The Post examined: During the nine increasingly tense weeks that led up to Jan. 6, the groups were inundated with posts attacking the legitimacy of Biden's election, while the pace of removals noticeably slowed.
Removals did not pick up again until the week of Jan. 6, but even then, many of the groups and their posts remained on the site for months after, as Trump supporters continued to falsely claim election fraud and press for states to conduct audits of the vote or impose new voting restrictions.
"Facebook took its eye off the ball in the interim time between Election Day and January 6," said a former Integrity team employee who worked on the groups task force and, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters. "There was a lot of violating content that did appear on the platform that wouldn't otherwise have."
Pusateri denied that the company had pulled back on efforts to combat violent and false postings about the election after the vote. He did not comment on the quantitative findings of the ProPublica-Post investigation.
"The idea that we deprioritized our Civic Integrity work in any way is simply not true," he said. "We integrated it into a larger Central Integrity team to allow us to apply the work that this team pioneered for elections to other challenges like health-related issues for example. Their work continues to this day."
The investigation also reveals a problem with the way Facebook polices its groups. Former employees say groups are essential to the company's ability to keep a stagnant American user base as engaged as possible and boost its revenue, which reached nearly $86 billion in 2020.
But they say that as groups have grown more central to Meta's bottom line, the company's enforcement efforts have been weak, inconsistent and heavily reliant on the work of unpaid group administrators to do the labor-intensive job of reviewing posts and removing the ones that violate company policies. Many groups have hundreds of thousands or even millions of members, dramatically escalating the challenges of policing posts.
With the administrators themselves steeped in conspiracy theories about the election or, for example, the safety of coronavirus vaccines, reliable enforcement rarely takes place, say former employees. They say automated tools - which search for particular terms indicating policy violations - are ineffective and easily evaded by users simply misspelling key words.
"Groups are a disaster," said Frances Haugen, a former member of Facebook's Civic Integrity team who filed a whistleblower complaint against the company and testified before Congress warning about the damaging effects of the company on democracy worldwide, as well as other problems.
Many of the group posts identified in the analysis fell into what a March internal Facebook report, first published by Politico, defined as "harmful non-violating narratives." This refers to content that does not break Facebook's rules but whose prevalence can cause people to "act in ways which are harmful to themselves, others, or society at large."
The report warned that such harmful narratives could have had "substantial negative impacts including contributing materially to the Capitol riot and potentially reducing collective civic engagement and social cohesion in the years to come."
Pusateri declined to comment on specific posts but said the company does not have a policy forbidding posts or comments that attack the legitimacy of the election. He said the company has a dedicated groups integrity team and an ongoing initiative to protect people who use groups from harm.
Facebook officials have noted that more-extreme content flowed through smaller social media platforms in the buildup to the Capitol attack, including detailed planning on bringing guns or building gallows that day. But Trump also used Facebook as a key platform for his lies about the election right up until he was banned on Jan. 6. And Facebook's reliance on groups to drive engagement gave those lies unequaled reach. This combined with the sag in post-election enforcement to make Facebook a key vector for pushing the ideas that fueled violence on Jan. 6.
Critics and former employees say this also underscores a recurring issue with the platform since its founding in Zuckerberg's Harvard University dorm room in 2004: The company recognizes the need for enforcement only after a problem has caused serious damage, often in the form of real-world mayhem and violence.
Facebook didn't discover a campaign by the Russia-based Internet Research Agency to spread hyperpartisan content and disinformation during the 2016 presidential election until months after Americans had voted. The company's actions were late as well when Myanmar's military leaders used Facebook to foment rapes, murders and forced migrations of minority Rohingya people. Facebook has apologized for failings in both cases.
The response to attacks on the legitimacy of the 2020 U.S. presidential election was similarly slow, as company officials debated among themselves whether and how to block the rapidly metastasizing lies about the election. The data shows they acted aggressively and comprehensively only after Trump supporters had battered their way into the Capitol, sending lawmakers fleeing for their lives.
The ProPublica-Post investigation "is a new and very important illustration of the company's unfortunate tendency to deal with safety problems on its platform in a reactive way," said Paul Barrett, deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University's Stern School of Business. "And that almost by definition means that the company will be less effective, because it will not be looking out into the future and preventing problems before they happen."
The problems with policing groups Facebook's newly vigorous enforcement actions the week of Jan. 6 - which resulted in Trump himself being banned from the platform - marked such a stark contrast from the company's previous approach that some Trump supporters took to Facebook to complain about the reversal.
"Facebook is Getting Real Brave and Vicious Now," Jerry Smith, a retired police officer from Missouri who created and ran a group called United Conservatives for America, wrote the day after the Capitol attack. "They Are Removing Tons of Posts From My Groups!"
In a recent interview at his home, Smith said he could not remember writing that message or which deletions prompted his response. He said he opposed political violence and posts that called for it. But he acknowledged it was difficult for him to remove such content as United Conservatives for America's membership swelled to more than 11,000, with the number of posts surpassing what one person could monitor. The typical group in the ProPublica-Post analysis had more than 1,000 members.
Smith, who showed a reporter that his Facebook account had received 116 notifications for breaking company rules, said he found some of Facebook's policies reasonable but disagreed on how they should be enforced. He posted in United Conservatives for America and other groups at a frenetic pace long before Election Day. As early as the summer of 2020, he warned about alleged Democratic Party plans to steal the election and also shared false information about the pandemic, including a video from a conspiracy theorist about the origins of the virus.
"And DEMS Are Pushing For Vote By Mail. Another Way For Them To Steal The Election," he wrote in August 2020.
In the interview, Smith said he believes that American elections often are rigged and worries that coronavirus vaccines may be tainted. He has used Facebook groups to share these beliefs with tens of thousands of people - and thinks Facebook's enforcement of its policies is overly aggressive and a result of political bias against conservatives.
"Are you going to do away with their free speech?" Smith said. "If someone thinks it's not a fair election … why can't they have their opinion on whether it's a fair election or not?"
Facebook enforcement slowed before Jan. 6 Facebook's problems with groups had long been obvious to company employees, who gathered on a remote video conference in early September 2020 to figure out how to stop them from spreading hate, violent threats and misinformation as Election Day approached, according to former employees.
Known as the Group Task Force, the new unit they formed consisted of members of Facebook's Civic Integrity team, the specialized unit charged with protecting elections on the platform, as well as employees from engineering and operations teams who help oversee the contract moderators who review posts flagged by users or by automated systems, former employees said. The goal of the task force was to identify political groups with large numbers of posts and comments that violated the social media giant's rules against hate speech and calls for violence. Former employees involved in the effort said they wanted to apply the platform's rules while respecting political debate and dialogue.
At the same time, Facebook's Dangerous Individuals and Organizations team was identifying and removing QAnon groups ahead of the election. The results of the two teams' actions were striking. All of the more than 300 QAnon groups identified by ProPublica and The Post had been removed by October 2020, when Facebook announced a total ban on the movement, the analysis found.
In the end, the Group Task Force removed nearly 400 groups whose posts had been seen nearly 1 billion times before Election Day, according to a post on Workplace, Facebook's internal discussion tool. The document later was included in the Facebook Papers disclosed by Haugen to Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Still, members of the task force told ProPublica and The Post that the existence of such a team was an indictment of Facebook's failure to police groups as part of its normal operations.
"The whole thing of the civic team needing to come in and do the takedowns was not a good state of affairs," said one employee involved in the task force. "You could make a good argument that this should have already been done."
On Nov. 5, 2020, Facebook banned "Stop the Steal," a hugely viral group created on Election Day itself that quickly attracted over 300,000 members around a message rooted in attacking the legitimacy of the election. The company cited the prevalence of posts calling for violence and using hate speech in banning the group and all other groups using a similar name.
The next day, Nov. 6, the Group Task Force gathered virtually to celebrate its efforts, former employees said. Days later, a task force member published a Workplace post titled "Some Reflections on US2020" to bring attention to its work.
"Along with heroic efforts from other teams across the company, I truly believe the Group Task Force made the election safer and prevented possible instances of real world violence," said the post.
But the focus on U.S. political groups and content undermining the election wouldn't last.
A noticeable drop in policing On Dec. 2, 2020, Facebook executives disbanded the Civic Integrity team and scattered its members to other parts of Facebook's overall integrity team, reducing their influence. That resulted in the demise of the Group Task Force. The company also rolled back several emergency measures that had been put in place leading up to Election Day to control misbehavior in Facebook groups.
The ProPublica-Post investigation reveals the result: During the lull in enforcement, hundreds of thousands of posts questioned the legitimacy of Biden's victory, spread lies about voter fraud and at times called for violence. Meanwhile, the company's pace of group removals slowed to a crawl, the data analysis shows.
Among the content spreading in groups were videos in which former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn spread false claims of electoral fraud and called for martial law. (Through a spokesperson, Flynn declined to comment.) Another frequent post was a cartoon showing Trump chasing a masked Biden, who carried a bag labeled "election theft," with swing states depicted inside. It was posted more than 350 times in the political groups analyzed by ProPublica and The Post, attracting over 2,500 total likes.
One meme featured a photo of former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), who rose to fame in right-wing circles by leading a congressional committee's investigation into the deadly 2012 attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, accompanied by the text "If you are ok with rigging an election to win, I am ok with martial law to stop you…" That was posted in groups at least 97 times, garnering over 3,500 total likes. Gowdy has denied saying the phrase.
Another meme showed a photo of Trump winking, with the text "Not Only Can Martial Law Guarantee a Trump Victory, It Also Allows Trump To Arrest Anyone He Wants!" It was posted at least 70 times, generating more than 2,400 total likes. The images and their spread in groups were identified using a CounterAction image-analysis tool.
"Everyone needs to make a show of FORCE in DC on the 6th and any congress who doesnt follow the constitution or who doesnt stand up for our president (Pence included) needs to be 'corrected' by WE the PEOPLE - on the front steps of the state house - for all the world to see!!! THIS IS HOW THE US DEALS WITH HER TRAITORS!!!" read one post from Dec. 27, 2020.
Ten days later, as rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol, the ProPublica-Post analysis shows, Facebook began taking down groups at a rate not seen since before the election. An internal Facebook spreadsheet from Jan. 6, which was included in Haugen's disclosures, contains a section called "Action Items." The top bullet point was a direction to conduct a "Sweep of Groups with V&I risk" - a term referring to violence and incitement.
It had been 35 days since the Civic Integrity team, and with it the Group Task Force, had been disbanded.
Groups still active long after Jan. 6 Months after the Capitol was breached, Facebook still was working to remove hundreds of political groups that violated company policies.
One of those was Smith's United Conservatives for America, which continued to carry posts attacking the legitimacy of Biden's election until Facebook removed it in May.
When Smith met with a reporter in his home early last month, he'd just finished a 30-day posting ban on Facebook. Despite his account's history of violations, he was still managing at least one Facebook group - also called United Conservatives for America.
Like its predecessor, the new United Conservatives for America group was racking up strikes for violations of Facebook's rules, according to a post Smith made to the group in September.
That post included a screenshot of an automated message from Facebook informing him that eight recent posts in the new United Conservatives for America group had been flagged by fact-checkers. As a result, the distribution of the group's posts was being limited.
Smith remained defiant.
"I'm Not Blaming Our Members," Smith wrote. "I'm Blaming FakeBook!"
Late last month, after being asked about Smith's account and group, Facebook said it banned his profile and removed United Conservatives for America, citing unspecified violations of its community standards.

Full text: Facebook groups swelled with at least 650,000 posts attacking the legitimacy of Joe Biden's victory between Election Day and the Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol, with many calling for executions or other political violence, an investigation by ProPublica and The Washington Post has found.
The barrage — averaging at least 10,000 posts a day, a scale not reported previously — turned the groups into incubators for the baseless claims supporters of President Donald Trump voiced as they stormed the Capitol, demanding he get a second term. Many posts portrayed Biden's election as the result of widespread fraud that required extraordinary action — including the use of force — to prevent the nation from falling into the hands of traitors.
"LOOKS LIKE CIVIL WAR is BECOMING INEVITABLE !!!" read a post a month before the Capitol assault. "WE CANNOT ALLOW FRAUDULENT ELECTIONS TO STAND ! SILENT NO MORE MAJORITY MUST RISE UP NOW AND DEMAND BATTLEGROUND STATES NOT TO CERTIFY FRAUDULENT ELECTIONS NOW !"
Another post, made 10 days after the 2020 election, bore an avatar of a smiling woman with her arms raised in apparent triumph and read, "WE ARE AMERICANS!!! WE FOUGHT AND DIED TO START OUR COUNTRY! WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT... FIGHT LIKE HELL. WE WILL SAVE HER❤ THEN WERE GOING TO SHOOT THE TRAITORS!!!!!!!!!!!"
One post showed a Civil War-era picture of a gallows with more than two dozen nooses and hooded figures waiting to be hanged. Other posts called for arrests and executions of specific public figures — both Democrats and Republicans — depicted as betraying the nation by denying Trump a second term.
"BILL BARR WE WILL BE COMING FOR YOU," wrote a group member after Barr announced that the Justice Department had found little evidence to support Trump's claims of widespread vote-rigging. "WE WILL HAVE CIVIL WAR IN THE STREETS BEFORE BIDEN WILL BE PRES."
Facebook executives have played down the company's role in the Jan. 6 attack and have resisted calls, including from its own Oversight Board, for a comprehensive internal investigation. The company also has yet to turn over all the information requested by the congressional committee studying the Jan. 6 attack, though it says it is negotiating with the committee.
But the ProPublica-Post investigation, which analyzed millions of posts between Election Day and Jan. 6 and drew on internal company documents and interviews with former employees, provides the clearest evidence yet that Facebook played a critical role in the spread of false narratives that fomented the violence of Jan. 6.
Its efforts to police such content, the investigation also found, were ineffective and started too late to quell the surge of angry, hateful misinformation coursing through Facebook groups — some of it explicitly calling for violent confrontation with government officials, a theme that foreshadowed the storming of the Capitol that day amid clashes that left five people dead.
Drew Pusateri, a spokesman for Meta, Facebook's newly renamed parent company, said that the platform was not responsible for the violence on Jan. 6. He pointed instead to Trump and others who voiced the lies that sparked the attack on the Capitol.
"The notion that the January 6 insurrection would not have happened but for Facebook is absurd," Pusateri said in a statement. "The former President of the United States pushed a narrative that the election was stolen, including in-person a short distance from the Capitol building that day. The responsibility for the violence that occurred on January 6 lies with those who attacked our Capitol and those who encouraged them."
To determine the extent of posts attacking Biden's victory, The Post and ProPublica obtained a unique dataset of 100,000 groups and their posts, along with metadata and images, compiled by CounterAction, a firm that studies online disinformation. The Post and ProPublica used machine learning to narrow that list to 27,000 public groups that showed clear markers of focusing on U.S. politics. Out of the more than 18 million posts in those groups between Election Day and Jan. 6, the analysis searched for words and phrases to identify attacks on the election's integrity.
The more than 650,000 posts attacking the election — and the 10,000-a-day average — is almost certainly an undercount. The ProPublica-Washington Post analysis examined posts in only a portion of all public groups, and did not include comments, posts in private groups or posts on individuals' profiles. Only Facebook has access to all the data to calculate the true total — and it hasn't done so publicly.
Facebook has heavily promoted groups since CEO Mark Zuckerberg made them a strategic priority in 2017. But the ones focused on U.S. politics have become so toxic, say former Facebook employees, that the company established a task force, whose existence has not been previously reported, specifically to police them ahead of Election Day 2020.
The task force removed hundreds of groups with violent or hateful content in the months before Nov. 3, 2020, according to the ProPublica-Post investigation.
Yet shortly after the vote, Facebook dissolved the task force and rolled back other intensive enforcement measures. The results of that decision were clear in the data ProPublica and The Post examined: During the nine increasingly tense weeks that led up to Jan. 6, the groups were inundated with posts attacking the legitimacy of Biden's election, while the pace of removals noticeably slowed.
Removals did not pick up again until the week of Jan. 6, but even then, many of the groups and their posts remained on the site for months after, as Trump supporters continued to falsely claim election fraud and press for states to conduct audits of the vote or impose new voting restrictions.

"Facebook took its eye off the ball in the interim time between Election Day and January 6," said a former Integrity team employee who worked on the groups task force and, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters. "There was a lot of violating content that did appear on the platform that wouldn't otherwise have."
Pusateri denied that the company had pulled back on efforts to combat violent and false postings about the election after the vote. He did not comment on the quantitative findings of the ProPublica-Post investigation.
"The idea that we deprioritized our Civic Integrity work in any way is simply not true," he said. "We integrated it into a larger Central Integrity team to allow us to apply the work that this team pioneered for elections to other challenges like health-related issues for example. Their work continues to this day."
The investigation also reveals a problem with the way Facebook polices its groups. Former employees say groups are essential to the company's ability to keep a stagnant American user base as engaged as possible and boost its revenue, which reached nearly $86 billion in 2020.
But they say that as groups have grown more central to Meta's bottom line, the company's enforcement efforts have been weak, inconsistent and heavily reliant on the work of unpaid group administrators to do the labor-intensive job of reviewing posts and removing the ones that violate company policies. Many groups have hundreds of thousands or even millions of members, dramatically escalating the challenges of policing posts.
With the administrators themselves steeped in conspiracy theories about the election or, for example, the safety of coronavirus vaccines, reliable enforcement rarely takes place, say former employees. They say automated tools — which search for particular terms indicating policy violations — are ineffective and easily evaded by users simply misspelling key words.
"Groups are a disaster," said Frances Haugen, a former member of Facebook's Civic Integrity team who filed a whistleblower complaint against the company and testified before Congress warning about the damaging effects of the company on democracy worldwide, as well as other problems.
Many of the group posts identified in the analysis fell into what a March internal Facebook report, first published by Politico, defined as"harmful non-violating narratives." This refers to content that does not break Facebook's rules but whose prevalence can cause people to "act in ways which are harmful to themselves, others, or society at large."
The report warned that such harmful narratives could have had "substantial negative impacts including contributing materially to the Capitol riot and potentially reducing collective civic engagement and social cohesion in the years to come."
Pusateri declined to comment on specific posts but said the company does not have a policy forbidding posts or comments that attack the legitimacy of the election. He said the company has a dedicated groups integrity team and an ongoing initiative to protect people who use groups from harm.
Facebook officials have noted that more-extreme content flowed through smaller social media platforms in the buildup to the Capitol attack, including detailed planning on bringing guns or building gallows that day. But Trump also used Facebook as a key platform for his lies about the election right up until he was banned on Jan. 6. And Facebook's reliance on groups to drive engagement gave those lies unequaled reach. This combined with the sag in post-election enforcement to make Facebook a key vector for pushing the ideas that fueled violence on Jan. 6.
Critics and former employees say this also underscores a recurring issue with the platform since its founding in Zuckerberg's Harvard University dorm room in 2004: The company recognizes the need for enforcement only after a problem has caused serious damage, often in the form of real-world mayhem and violence.
Facebook didn't discover a campaign by the Russia-based Internet Research Agency to spread hyperpartisan content and disinformation during the 2016 presidential election until months after Americans had voted. The company's actions were late as well when Myanmar's military leaders used Facebook to foment rapes, murders and forced migrations of minority Rohingya people. Facebook has apologized for failings in both cases.
The response to attacks on the legitimacy of the 2020 U.S. presidential election was similarly slow, as company officials debated among themselves whether and how to block the rapidly metastasizing lies about the election. The data shows they acted aggressively and comprehensively only after Trump supporters had battered their way into the Capitol, sending lawmakers fleeing for their lives.
The ProPublica-Post investigation "is a new and very important illustration of the company's unfortunate tendency to deal with safety problems on its platform in a reactive way," said Paul Barrett, deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University's Stern School of Business. "And that almost by definition means that the company will be less effective, because it will not be looking out into the future and preventing problems before they happen."
The problems with policing groups
Facebook's newly vigorous enforcement actions the week of Jan. 6 — which resulted in Trump himself being banned from the platform — marked such a stark contrast from the company's previous approach that some Trump supporters took to Facebook to complain about the reversal.
"Facebook is Getting Real Brave and Vicious Now," Jerry Smith, a retired police officer from Missouri who created and ran a group called United Conservatives for America, wrote the day after the Capitol attack. "They Are Removing Tons of Posts From My Groups!"
In a recent interview at his home, Smith said he could not remember writing that message or which deletions prompted his response. He said he opposed political violence and posts that called for it. But he acknowledged it was difficult for him to remove such content as United Conservatives for America's membership swelled to more than 11,000, with the number of posts surpassing what one person could monitor. The typical group in the ProPublica-Post analysis had more than 1,000 members.
Smith, who showed a reporter that his Facebook account had received 116 notifications for breaking company rules, said he found some of Facebook's policies reasonable but disagreed on how they should be enforced. He posted in United Conservatives for America and other groups at a frenetic pace long before Election Day. As early as the summer of 2020, he warned about alleged Democratic Party plans to steal the election and also shared false information about the pandemic, including a video from a conspiracy theorist about the origins of the virus.
"And DEMS Are Pushing For Vote By Mail. Another Way For Them To Steal The Election," he wrote in August 2020.
In the interview, Smith said he believes that American elections often are rigged and worries that coronavirus vaccines may be tainted. He has used Facebook groups to share these beliefs with tens of thousands of people — and thinks Facebook's enforcement of its policies is overly aggressive and a result of political bias against conservatives.
"Are you going to do away with their free speech?" Smith said. "If someone thinks it's not a fair election … why can't they have their opinion on whether it's a fair election or not?"
Facebook enforcement slowed before Jan. 6
Facebook's problems with groups had long been obvious to company employees, who gathered on a remote video conference in early September 2020 to figure out how to stop them from spreading hate, violent threats and misinformation as Election Day approached, according to former employees.
Known as the Group Task Force, the new unit they formed consisted of members of Facebook's Civic Integrity team, the specialized unit charged with protecting elections on the platform, as well as employees from engineering and operations teams who help oversee the contract moderators who review posts flagged by users or by automated systems, former employees said. The goal of the task force was to identify political groups with large numbers of posts and comments that violated the social media giant's rules against hate speech and calls for violence. Former employees involved in the effort said they wanted to apply the platform's rules while respecting political debate and dialogue.
At the same time, Facebook's Dangerous Individuals and Organizations team was identifying and removing QAnon groups ahead of the election. The results of the two teams' actions were striking. All of the more than 300 QAnon groups identified by ProPublica and The Post had been removed by October 2020, when Facebook announced a total ban on the movement, the analysis found.

In the end, the Group Task Force removed nearly 400 groups whose posts had been seen nearly 1 billion times before Election Day, according to a post on Workplace, Facebook's internal discussion tool. The document later was included in the Facebook Papers disclosed by Haugen to Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Still, members of the task force told ProPublica and The Post that the existence of such a team was an indictment of Facebook's failure to police groups as part of its normal operations.
"The whole thing of the civic team needing to come in and do the takedowns was not a good state of affairs," said one employee involved in the task force. "You could make a good argument that this should have already been done."
On Nov. 5, 2020, Facebook banned "Stop the Steal," a hugely viral group created on Election Day itself that quickly attracted over 300,000 members around a message rooted in attacking the legitimacy of the election. The company cited the prevalence of posts calling for violence and using hate speech in banning the group and all other groups using a similar name.
The next day, Nov. 6, the Group Task Force gathered virtually to celebrate its efforts, former employees said. Days later, a task force member published a Workplace post titled "Some Reflections on US2020" to bring attention to its work.
"Along with heroic efforts from other teams across the company, I truly believe the Group Task Force made the election safer and prevented possible instances of real world violence," said the post.
But the focus on U.S. political groups and content undermining the election wouldn't last.
A noticeable drop in policing
On Dec. 2, 2020, Facebook executives disbanded the Civic Integrity team and scattered its members to other parts of Facebook's overall integrity team, reducing their influence. That resulted in the demise of the Group Task Force. The company also rolled back several emergency measures that had been put in place leading up to Election Day to control misbehavior in Facebook groups.
The ProPublica-Post investigation reveals the result: During the lull in enforcement, hundreds of thousands of posts questioned the legitimacy of Biden's victory, spread lies about voter fraud and at times called for violence. Meanwhile, the company's pace of group removals slowed to a crawl, the data analysis shows.
Among the content spreading in groups were videos in which former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn spread false claims of electoral fraud and called for martial law. (Through a spokesperson, Flynn declined to comment.) Another frequent post was a cartoon showing Trump chasing a masked Biden, who carried a bag labeled "election theft," with swing states depicted inside. It was posted more than 350 times in the political groups analyzed by ProPublica and The Post, attracting over 2,500 total likes.
One meme featured a photo of former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), who rose to fame in right-wing circles by leading a congressional committee's investigation into the deadly 2012 attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, accompanied by the text "If you are ok with rigging an election to win, I am ok with martial law to stop you…" That was posted in groups at least 97 times, garnering over 3,500 total likes. Gowdy has denied saying the phrase.
Another meme showed a photo of Trump winking, with the text "Not Only Can Martial Law Guarantee a Trump Victory, It Also Allows Trump To Arrest Anyone He Wants!" It was posted at least 70 times, generating more than 2,400 total likes. The images and their spread in groups were identified using a CounterAction image-analysis tool.
"Everyone needs to make a show of FORCE in DC on the 6th and any congress who doesnt follow the constitution or who doesnt stand up for our president (Pence included) needs to be 'corrected' by WE the PEOPLE - on the front steps of the state house - for all the world to see!!! THIS IS HOW THE US DEALS WITH HER TRAITORS!!!" read one post from Dec. 27, 2020.
Ten days later, as rioters stormed the Capitol, the ProPublica-Post analysis shows, Facebook began taking down groups at a rate not seen since before the election. An internal Facebook spreadsheet from Jan. 6, which was included in Haugen's disclosures, contains a section called "Action Items." The top bullet point was a direction to conduct a "Sweep of Groups with V&I risk" — a term referring to violence and incitement.
It had been 35 days since the Civic Integrity team, and with it the Group Task Force, had been disbanded.
Groups still active long after Jan. 6
Months after the Capitol was breached, Facebook still was working to remove hundreds of political groups that violated company policies.
One of those was Smith's United Conservatives for America, which continued to carry posts attacking the legitimacy of Biden's election until Facebook removed it in May.
When Smith met with a reporter in his home early last month, he'd just finished a 30-day posting ban on Facebook. Despite his account's history of violations, he was still managing at least one Facebook group — also called United Conservatives for America.
Like its predecessor, the new United Conservatives for America group was racking up strikes for violations of Facebook's rules, according to a post Smith made to the group in September.
That post included a screenshot of an automated message from Facebook informing him that eight recent posts in the new United Conservatives for America group had been flagged by fact-checkers. As a result, the distribution of the group's posts was being limited.
Smith remained defiant.
"I'm Not Blaming Our Members," Smith wrote. "I'm Blaming FakeBook!"
Late last month, after being asked about Smith's account and group, Facebook said it banned his profile and removed United Conservatives for America, citing unspecified violations of its community standards.

Full text: For generations of parents, Heidi Murkoff's 1984 pregnancy guide "What to Expect When You're Expecting" has been a trusted companion, offering calm, scientifically informed advice for a nerve-racking nine months.
These days, of course, there's an app for that: What to Expect's "Pregnancy & Baby Tracker," which offers personalized articles, videos, graphics of the baby's development, and other features based on due date.
But parents who have used What to Expect's app say they also are offered something they weren't expecting: a "community" section rife with scare stories, conspiracy theories and outright falsehoods about the safety of vaccines, posted by other users and surfaced by the app's search functions and email notifications.
Mashaya Engel, 26, who gave birth to her daughter in August, said she encountered multiple posts expressing skepticism about the safety of getting vaccinated against the coronavirus during pregnancy. "I searched in the group discussions for vaccines, and it popped up - some moms having discussions about not vaccinating your children, or getting delayed vaccines," Engel said. Other users noted a similar phenomenon: "Most antivax and microchip conspiracy comments ive ever seen," one tweeted in May.
While social media giants such as Facebook and YouTube have faced heavy pressure to crack down on misinformation during the pandemic, smaller apps have also struggled to police their platforms and rein in falsehoods. Apps aimed at first-time parents, who often face an overwhelming volume of choices and information, have proved particularly vulnerable to users looking to promote all types of vaccine hesitancy.
On the app Glow, for example, which helps users track ovulation, a search for "vaccine" turns up numerous posts in which parents discourage each other from vaccinating their children. There's also a review of a children's book called "Vaccine-Free Me: A Trip to the Doctor" with a link to purchase the book on Amazon.
On the book's Amazon store page, a description says that "Charlie is excited to go to his yearly doctor appointment . . . Can he keep his cool and explain to the doctor why he will NOT be getting vaccinated?" (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
And on the parent-connecting app Peanut, named one of the Best Apps of 2021 by Apple, lists of books and resources about the purported dangers of vaccines have circulated in the discussion forums.
Sites including What to Expect and Peanut have had policies against misinformation about vaccines for years. But for a long time, they didn't strictly police it - until falsehoods and fear-mongering about the coronavirus vaccines brought into stark relief the impact of allowing it to percolate. Widespread misinformation linking the coronavirus vaccine to infertility and pregnancy complications has been blamed for low vaccination rates among pregnant individuals. Only 35 percent of pregnant people ages 18 to 49 had been fully vaccinated as of Dec. 4, nearly four months after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released data supporting a recommendation for pregnant people to be vaccinated.
This year, What to Expect's Pregnancy & Baby Tracker, which has 2 million users a month, made significant new investments in content moderation and began banning conspiracy theorists on the first offense, the company told The Post last month. The difference was clear: By late November, a review of its forums turned up far fewer posts casting doubt on the coronavirus vaccines' safety and more signs of posts and threads that had been taken down.
"It changed," said Engel, a graduate student in Reliance, S.D., and a social services assistant at a behavioral health clinic on a Native American reservation. She also noticed more articles encouraging users to get vaccinated. "It was like [the app was] kind of, like, more 'for it' - for pregnant moms getting vaccinated."
Hannah Hastings, head of brand and communications for Peanut, told The Post in a statement that it had removed the aforementioned anti-vaccine posts and banned their authors in line with its 2019 community guidelines. Glow did not respond to a request for comment.
The experience of What to Expect shows that, when smaller apps prioritize content moderation, the results can be striking.
What to Expect has "gradually redefined how we moderate posts about vaccines," Christine Mattheis, the site's vice president and editorial director, wrote in an email, as "vaccine misinformation has increased in our community during the COVID-19 pandemic."
Over the past few weeks, the omicron variant has increased the urgency of questions on the What to Expect discussion boards about vaccination for both pregnant individuals and children ages 5 to 11. Users have sought advice on whether to get a booster shot during pregnancy as an extra layer of protection against the omicron variant.
Any platform that allows users to interact or create content eventually will face questions about how to deal with offensive speech, said Evelyn Douek, a lecturer at Harvard Law School who researches online content moderation. Smaller sites often lack the resources to moderate users' discussions as effectively as the large platforms, she added, and can become hubs of misinformation.
On What to Expect, the community aspect is built into its identity - "word of mom" is how Murkoff, the author of the best-selling book, describes the way that users interact and support each other. "We have to give their worries a platform, without giving a platform to the misinformation that's fueling their worries," she said.
Part of a franchise built around the book series, the Pregnancy & Baby Tracker projects scientific credibility and promises thousands of medically accurate articles, plus stories from parents and parents-to-be. It's part of a digital media entity called Everyday Health Group, which includes the parenting site BabyCenter, clinical news outlet MedPage Today and wellness brand DailyOm, among others.
Like other pregnancy and parenting apps, What to Expect features community pages where people can connect with others who share their interests, concerns or due-date month. These were among the pages that users say became hotbeds of vaccine scare stories, conspiracy theories and misinformation.
The app's "Top Stories" tab listed numerous, apparently professionally written articles, rooted in evidence, according to a search on the app for "vaccines" in October. There were official recommendations that the coronavirus vaccines are safe and effective for people who are pregnant, with the benefits outweighing the risks. For example, one article was titled "No evidence that Covid-19 vaccines increase miscarriage risk during pregnancy."
One swipe to the left, however - to the "Discussions" tab, or the chat forum - and things got murky. A discussion page titled "Any moms not sure about Vaccines" touted "Doctor Paul Thomas's delayed vaccine schedule plan" for routine childhood vaccinations. The plan recommends "no vaccines" during pregnancy, skipping babies' vaccinations for Hepatitis B, Rotavirus and IPV, among others, and makes the MMR vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella optional. A respondent pointed out that Thomas had his medical license suspended for misleading patients about vaccinations; another replied, "That just makes me want to follow his vaccine schedule." Thomas didn't respond to a request for comment from The Post.
The majority of respondents were either supportive or sympathetic to skipping vaccines. Parents offered tips on how to find pediatricians who won't "push back" and what states allow vaccination exemptions for religion or personal belief.
A commenter identifying herself as a registered nurse wrote, "my baby is unvaccinated completely! She hasn't even had a needle touch her yet at almost two years old. Healthy as a horse." Numerous respondents cheered her on and said it was good to hear such reassurances from a nurse. One said she'd performed "too many autopsies on babies and small children . . . and noticed 'well child visit' in their history info within the last 14 days."
Conspiracy theories about vaccines long flourished on sites such as What to Expect. Many experts considered it a form of debate - that it was healthy to tolerate different viewpoints.
What made the debates feel high stakes on the What to Expect app was that people were coming there unsure, asking questions and looking to the community to help make decisions, said Renee DiResta, research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory and an expert on digital communities.
"Nobody believed they were going to change the mind of the diehards on either side of things," DiResta said. "But there were a lot of people who hadn't given a lot of thought to vaccinations prior to getting pregnant, because this is a major phase shift in their life. There's a major opportunity to reach people, because they're trying to make the best decision for their baby."
Most people who are having a baby can't realistically expect to be able to reach their doctors for reassurance every time they have a hyper-specific question or whenever something feels a little weird. But they can look to others, and often do, in places like What to Expect.
For Claire, a 32-year-old from New York City who works in film and is expecting her first child, that impulse to connect with other pregnant individuals proved powerful. (She spoke on the condition of only using her first name for fear of online harassment.)
Thrilled and nervous after a positive pregnancy test, Claire downloaded the app the same day. She followed prompts to join a forum for those with January due dates and began receiving daily automated email digests of the discussion threads.
She soon found, to her dismay, that the forum's top posts over the summer often included conspiracy theories about vaccines, including the coronavirus vaccines. Though Claire had resolved to get vaccinated before downloading What to Expect, she was afraid to click. She knew she was vulnerable. She didn't trust herself not to get spooked.
The presence of anti-vaccine rhetoric wasn't entirely surprising to Claire, though it irked her that the app seemed to be "actively serving it to you without you looking for it" via the email digests. "What really . . . alarmed me was people trading advice on how to get around vaccine mandates" at their workplaces and children's schools, she said. For example, in one thread that came to her inbox, "Somebody who was pregnant but had other children was asking other moms for advice on how to forge vaccine documents for their kid's school."
The CDC's release of an official stance on vaccination during pregnancy was an inflection point for What to Expect. "We drew the hardest line when the CDC began explicitly recommending that pregnant people get vaccinated, and released a lot of data showing that not getting vaccinated is far more dangerous than the shot itself," Mattheis wrote.
What to Expect already had a policy against posts that contained blatant vaccine disinformation. But it hadn't been as focused on enforcing it. And, as Mattheis noted, "the total volume of this violation type has risen so dramatically this year."
What to Expect has adopted some strategies to combat the proliferation of misinformation on the discussion pages, Mattheis said. First, What to Expect expanded its moderation staff's hours so that its nine moderators now work in shifts to ensure around-the-clock coverage.
Mattheis also noted that the app developers built a keyword detector that would flag posts about vaccines for moderator review and invested in a third-party "abuse-detection service" to identify and flag potential misinformation. The company also adjusted its user interface to make reporting misinformation and guideline violations easier, adding "misinformation/conspiracy" to the list of violations that members can report.
The company regularly adds to its collection of "evidence-based, medically reviewed articles" about vaccines (the coronavirus shots and routine childhood immunizations), and provides video content featuring Murkoff talking with public health officials including Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and CDC Director Rochelle Walensky.
By late November, not one of the top 15 discussion threads under the "vaccines" search included conspiracy theories or evident misinformation about the coronavirus. One thread titled "Theory: COVID Vaccine caused my miscarriage" raised questions about whether vaccination could be blamed. The majority of replies assured the original poster that it was most likely a coincidence. Several users noted that they had friends or relatives who had conceived successfully after vaccination, while others pointed out that miscarriages are common among the unvaccinated as well.
Still, of course, these measures are limited in their power to quash misinformation. Not every post that should be flagged gets flagged; human moderators and AI detection systems both fail sometimes, or don't recognize and delete misinformation as quickly as would be ideal. Plus, Mattheis added, anti-vaccine activists often understand and successfully evade What to Expect's screening tools.
What to Expect's struggles with vaccine conspiracy theories makes for "a fascinating case study," said Harvard's Douek. "It's a lot to expect from What to Expect to develop really sensitive and nuanced content moderation technology to distinguish lies from opinion from disinformation." Those issues challenge even the tech giants that have vast resources.
On the other hand, Douek added, niche apps may represent a more tractable moderation issue if people accept that they're not meant to be a public square for political speech.
"You have some sympathy for the people that run these platforms wanting to just provide a forum for people to discuss these issues," Douek said. "And then suddenly they're thrust into this unenviable role of deciding the boundaries of public conversation."

Full text: The archbishop, a powerful force for nonviolence in South Africa’s anti-apartheid movement, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984.
Desmond M. Tutu, the cleric who used his pulpit and spirited oratory to help bring down apartheid in South Africa and then became the leading advocate of peaceful reconciliation under Black majority rule, died on Sunday in Cape Town. He was 90.
His death was confirmed by the office of South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, who called the archbishop “a leader of principle and pragmatism who gave meaning to the biblical insight that faith without works is dead.”
The cause of death was cancer, the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation said, adding that Archbishop Tutu had died in a care facility. He was first diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997, and was hospitalized several times in the years since, amid recurring fears that the disease had spread.
As leader of the South African Council of Churches and later as Anglican archbishop of Cape Town, Archbishop Tutu led the church to the forefront of Black South Africans’ decades-long struggle for freedom. His voice was a powerful force for nonviolence in the anti-apartheid movement, earning him a Nobel Peace Prize in 1984.
When that movement triumphed in the early 1990s, he prodded the country toward a new relationship between its white and Black citizens, and, as chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, he gathered testimony documenting the viciousness of apartheid.
“You are overwhelmed by the extent of evil,” he said. But, he added, it was necessary to open the wound to cleanse it. In return for an honest accounting of past crimes, the committee offered amnesty, establishing what Archbishop Tutu called the principle of restorative — rather than retributive — justice.
His credibility was crucial to the commission’s efforts to get former members of the South African security forces and former guerrilla fighters to cooperate with the inquiry.
Archbishop Tutu preached that the policy of apartheid was as dehumanizing to the oppressors as it was to the oppressed. At home, he stood against looming violence and sought to bridge the chasm between Black and white; abroad, he urged economic sanctions against the South African government to force a change of policy.
But as much as he had inveighed against the apartheid-era leadership, he displayed equal disapproval of leading figures in the dominant African National Congress, which came to power under Nelson Mandela in the first fully democratic elections in 1994.
In 2004, the archbishop accused President Thabo Mbeki, Mr. Mandela’s successor, of pursuing policies that enriched a tiny elite while “many, too many, of our people live in grueling, demeaning, dehumanizing poverty.”
“We are sitting on a powder keg,” he said.
Although he and Mr. Mbeki later reconciled — they were photographed together in 2015 as Mr. Mbeki, by then the former president, visited Archbishop Tutu in a hospital — the archbishop remained unhappy about the state of affairs in his country under its next president, Jacob G. Zuma, who had denied Mr. Mbeki another term despite being embroiled in scandal.
“I think we are at a bad place in South Africa,” Archbishop Tutu told The New York Times Magazine in 2010, “and especially when you contrast it with the Mandela era. Many of the things that we dreamed were possible seem to be getting more and more out of reach. We have the most unequal society in the world.”
Then, in 2011, as critics accused the A.N.C. of corruption and mismanagement, Archbishop Tutu again assailed the government, this time in terms that would have once been unimaginable. “This government, our government, is worse than the apartheid government,” he said, “because at least you were expecting it with the apartheid government.”
He added: “Mr. Zuma, you and your government don’t represent me. You represent your own interests. I am warning you out of love, one day we will start praying for the defeat of the A.N.C. government. You are disgraceful.”
His words seemed prophetic when, in 2016, an alliance of religious leaders in South Africa joined other critics in urging Mr. Zuma to quit. In early 2018, Mr. Zuma was ousted after a power struggle with his deputy, Mr. Ramaphosa, who took over the presidency in February of that year.
By then, Archbishop Tutu had largely stopped giving interviews because of failing health and rarely appeared in public. But a few months after Mr. Ramaphosa was sworn in as the new president with the promise of a “new dawn” for the nation, the archbishop welcomed him at his home.
“Know that we pray regularly for you and your colleagues that this must not be a false dawn,” Archbishop Tutu warned Mr. Ramaphosa.
At that time, support for the African National Congress had declined, even though it remained the country’s biggest political party. In elections in 2016, while still under the leadership of Mr. Zuma, the party’s share of the vote slipped to its lowest level since the end of apartheid. Mr. Ramaphosa struggled to reverse that trend, but earned some praise later for his robust handling of the coronavirus crisis.
A Global Celebrity
For much of his life, Archbishop Tutu was a spellbinding preacher, his voice by turns sonorous and high-pitched. He often descended from the pulpit to embrace his parishioners. Occasionally he would break into a pixielike dance in the aisles, punctuating his message with the wit and the chuckling that became his hallmark, inviting his audience into a jubilant bond of fellowship. While assuring his parishioners of God’s love, he exhorted them to follow the path of nonviolence in their struggle.
Politics were inherent in his religious teachings. “We had the land, and they had the Bible,” he said in one of his parables. “Then they said, ‘Let us pray,’ and we closed our eyes. When we opened them again, they had the land and we had the Bible. Maybe we got the better end of the deal.”
His moral leadership, combined with his winning effervescence, made him something of a global celebrity. He was photographed at glittering social functions, appeared in documentaries and chatted with talk-show hosts. Even in late 2015, when his health seemed poor, he met with Prince Harry of Britain, who presented him with an honor on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II.
A compact, restless man — for many years he kept fit by jogging at 4:30 every morning — Archbishop Tutu had piercing eyes that were barely concealed by rimless glasses. When he traveled abroad, he cut a handsome figure in his well-tailored gray suit over a magenta shirt with a white clerical collar.
Apparently convinced of the virtues of modesty, he never seemed to accustom himself to the perquisites of fame and high office. He was unfailingly on time, always expressed appreciation to the bellhops and maids sent to wait on him, and was uncomfortable with limousines and police escorts.
“You know, back home, when you hear a police siren, you figure that they are coming to get you,” he once told a reporter from The Washington Post. “It still makes me a bit nervous riding with them.”
Although Archbishop Tutu, like other Black South Africans of his era, had suffered through the horrors and indignities of apartheid, he did not allow himself to hate his enemies. When he was young, he said, he was fortunate in the white priests that he knew, and throughout the long struggle against apartheid he remained an optimist. “Justice, goodness, love, compassion must prevail,” he said during a visit to New York in 1990. “Freedom is breaking out. Freedom is coming.”
He coined the phrase “rainbow nation” to describe the new South Africa emerging into democracy, and called for vigorous debate among all races.
Archbishop Tutu had always said that he was a priest, not a politician, and that when the real leaders of the movement against apartheid returned from jail or exile he would serve as its chaplain. While he acknowledged that there was a political role for the church, he prohibited ordained clergy from belonging to any political party.
In 1989, after President F.W. de Klerk had at last started to dismantle apartheid, Archbishop Tutu stepped aside, handing the leadership of the struggle back to Mr. Mandela on his release from prison in 1990.
But Archbishop Tutu did not stay entirely out of the nation’s business. “We’ve struggled to get these guys where they are, and we’re not going to let them fail,” he said. “We didn’t swallow all that tear gas, and be chased around and be sent to jail and into exile and killed, for failure.”
From Teacher to Preacher
Desmond Mpilo Tutu was born on Oct. 7, 1931, in Klerksdorp, on the Witwatersrand in what is now the North West Province of South Africa. His mother, Aletha, was a domestic worker; his father, Zachariah, taught at a Methodist school. The young Desmond was baptized a Methodist, but the entire family later joined the Anglican Church. When he was 12 the family moved to Johannesburg, where his mother found work as a cook in a school for the blind.
While he never forgot his father’s shame when a white policeman called him “boy” in front of his son, he was even more deeply affected when a white man in a priest’s robe tipped his hat to his mother, he said.
The white man was the Rev. Trevor Huddleston, a prominent campaigner against apartheid. When Desmond was hospitalized with tuberculosis, Father Huddleston visited him almost every day. “This little boy very well could have died,” Father Huddleston told an interviewer many years later, “but he didn’t give up, and he never lost his glorious sense of humor.”
After his recovery, Desmond wanted to become a doctor, but his family could not afford the school fees. Instead he became a teacher, studying at the Pretoria Bantu Normal College and earning a bachelor’s degree from the University of South Africa. He taught high school for three years but resigned to protest the Bantu Education Act, which lowered education standards for Black students.
By then he was married to Nomalizo Leah Shenxane, a major influence in his life; the couple celebrated 60 years of marriage by publicly renewing their wedding vows in July 2015. She survives him, as do their four children: a son, Trevor Thamsanqa Tutu, and three daughters, Theresa Thandeka Tutu, Naomi Nontombi Tutu and Mpho Tutu van Furth, as well as seven grandchildren.
Archbishop Tutu turned to the ministry, he said, because he thought it could provide “a likely means of service.” He studied at St. Peter’s Theological College in Johannesburg and was ordained an Anglican priest at St. Mary’s Cathedral in December 1961, less than two years after protests convulsed the town of Sharpeville, 40 miles from Johannesburg.
After serving in local churches, he studied in England, where he earned a bachelor of divinity degree and a master’s in theology from King’s College in London. When he returned to South Africa he was a lecturer, and from 1972 to 1975 he served as associate director of the Theological Education Fund, traveling widely in Asia and Africa and administering scholarships for the World Council of Churches.
He was named Anglican dean of Johannesburg in 1975 and consecrated bishop of Lesotho the next year. In 1978 he became the first Black general secretary of the South African Council of Churches, and began to establish the organization as a major force in the movement against apartheid.
Under Bishop Tutu’s leadership, the council established scholarships for Black youths and organized self-help programs in Black townships. There were also more controversial programs: Lawyers were hired to represent Black defendants on trial under the security laws, and support was provided for the families of those detained without trial.
As bishop, he spoke out against the establishment of tribal “homelands” and used the council as a platform to urge foreign investors to pull out of South Africa.
A month after he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, Desmond Tutu became the first Black Anglican bishop of Johannesburg when the national church hierarchy intervened to break a deadlock between Black and white electors. He was named archbishop of Cape Town in 1986, becoming spiritual head of the country’s 1.5 million Anglicans, 80 percent of whom were Black.
He preached forbearance but, as he insisted to The Christian Century magazine in 1980, “I am a man of peace, but not a pacifist.”
In an interview in the early 1980s, he said: “Blacks don’t believe that they are introducing violence into the situation. They believe that the situation is already violent.”
“I will never tell someone to pick up a gun,” he said in another interview “But I will pray for the man who picks up the gun, pray that he will be less cruel than he might otherwise have been, because he is a member of the community. We are going to have to decide: If this civil war escalates, what is our ministry going to be?”
He demonstrated his personal bravery in 1985 when, still a bishop, he helped to rescue a Black police informer from a mob in Duduza, a South African township.
Archbishop Tutu also spoke out against President Ronald Reagan’s policy of “constructive engagement,” which was intended to show impartiality in South African domestic affairs for what were said to be strategic purposes.
“To be impartial,” he said, “is indeed to have taken sides already with the status quo. How are you to remain impartial when the South African authorities evict helpless mothers and children and let them shiver in the winter rain?”
He remained equally outspoken even in later years. In 2003 he criticized his own government for backing Zimbabwe’s president, Robert Mugabe, who had a long record of human rights abuses.
In 2010 he unsuccessfully urged a touring Cape Town opera company not to perform in Israel, invoking South Africa’s struggle against apartheid in criticizing Israel’s policy toward Palestinians. He said that the company’s production of “Porgy and Bess” should be postponed “until both Israeli and Palestinian opera lovers of the region have equal opportunity and unfettered access to attend performances.”
Man of Forgiveness
Archbishop Tutu was the author of many books, including collections of his sermons and addresses, illustrated children’s books and forward-looking works about South Africa like “God Has a Dream: A Vision of Hope for Our Time” (2004) and “Made for Goodness” (2010), which he wrote with his daughter Mpho, an Episcopal priest. (She was forced to give up her priest’s license in South Africa after marrying a woman.)
On his frequent trips abroad during the apartheid era, Archbishop Tutu never stopped pressing the case for sanctions against South Africa. The government struck back and twice revoked his passport, forcing him to travel with a document that described his citizenship as “undetermined.”
But as the author of a 1999 book titled “No Future Without Forgiveness,” he was generous in forgiving his enemies, and when the de Klerk government took steps in 1989 toward ending apartheid, Archbishop Tutu was among the first to welcome the prospect of change.
“An extraordinary thing has happened in South Africa,” he said in 1990,“and it is undoubtedly due to the courage of President de Klerk. We’ve got someone here who is greater than we expected. At some points we had to pinch ourselves to be sure we were seeing what we were seeing.”
Still, when the Truth and Reconciliation Commission issued its final findings in 2003, Archbishop Tutu’s imprint was plain. It warned the government against issuing a blanket amnesty to perpetrators of the crimes of apartheid and urged businesses to join with the government in delivering reparations to the millions of Black people victimized by the former white minority government.
The report further said that Mr. de Klerk had knowingly withheld information from the commission about state-sponsored violations, and it reiterated charges against the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, South Africa’s second-largest Black party, accusing it of having collaborated with white supremacists in the massacre of hundreds of people in the early 1990s.
Archbishop Tutu officially retired from public duties in 2010. One of his last major appearances came that year, when South Africa hosted the World Cup.
But he did not retreat from the public eye entirely. In June 2011, he joined Michelle Obama at the new Cape Town Stadium, built for the tournament, where she was promoting physical fitness during a tour of southern Africa.
Inside the stadium, Ms. Obama got down on the floor to perform a few push-ups, and Archbishop Tutu, seeming keen to join in, dropped to the floor and did the same. Rising to their feet, a bit winded, they congratulated each other with a fist bump.
Archbishop Tutu continued to make occasional forays into the limelight, even as he grew more infirm.
In 2021, as he approached his 90th birthday, he pitched into a fraught debate as disinformation about coronavirus vaccines swirled.
“There is nothing to fear,” he said. “Don’t let Covid-19 continue to ravage our country, or our world. Vaccinate.”

Full text: For generations of parents, Heidi Murkoff's 1984 pregnancy guide "What to Expect When You're Expecting" has been a trusty companion, offering calm, scientifically informed advice for a nerve-wracking nine months.
These days, of course, there's an app for that: What to Expect's "Pregnancy & Baby Tracker," which offers personalized articles, videos, graphics of your baby's development, and other features based on your due date.
But parents who've used What To Expect's app say they also offered something they weren't expecting: a "community" section rife with scare stories, conspiracy theories, and outright falsehoods about the safety of vaccines, posted by other users and surfaced by the app's search functions and email notifications.
Mashaya Engel, 26, who gave birth to a daughter in August, said she encountered multiple posts expressing skepticism about the safety of getting vaccinated against the coronavirus during pregnancy. "I searched in the group discussions for vaccines, and it popped up — some moms having discussions about not vaccinating your children, or getting delayed vaccines," Engel said. Other users noted a similar phenomenon: "Most antivax and microchip conspiracy comments I've ever seen," one tweeted in May.
While social media giants like Facebook and YouTube have faced heavy pressure to crack down on misinformation during the pandemic, smaller apps have also struggled to police their platforms and rein in falsehoods. Apps aimed at first-time parents, who often face an overwhelming volume of new decisions, have proven particularly vulnerable to users looking to promote all manner of vaccine hesitancy.
On Glow, for example, which helps users track their ovulation patterns, a search for "vaccine" turns up numerous posts in which parents discourage each other from vaccinating their kids. There's also a review of a children's book called "Vaccine-Free Me: A Trip to the Doctor" with a link to purchase the book on Amazon. ("Charlie is excited to go to his yearly doctor appointment … Can he explain to the doctor why he will NOT be getting vaccinated?")
And on the parent-connecting app Peanut, named one of the Best Apps of 2021 by Apple, lists of books and resources about the purported dangers of vaccines have circulated in the discussion forums.
Sites including What to Expect and Peanut have for years had policies against misinformation about vaccines. But for a long time, they didn't strictly police it — until falsehoods and fear-mongering about the covid vaccines brought into stark relief the impact of allowing it to percolate. Widespread misinformation linking the covid vaccine to infertility and pregnancy complications has been blamed for low vaccination rates among pregnant individuals. Only 35 percent of pregnant people between 18 and 49 had been fully vaccinated as of Dec. 4, nearly four months after the CDC released new data supporting a recommendation for pregnant people to be vaccinated.
This year, What to Expect's "Pregnancy & Baby Tracker," which has 2 million users a month, made significant new investments in content moderation and began banning conspiracy theorists on the first offense, the company told The Post last month. The difference was readily apparent: By late November, a review of its forums turned up far fewer posts casting doubt on vaccines' safety and more signs of posts and threads that had been taken down. (Much of the same content can be accessed from What To Expect's app and its website.)
"It changed," said Engel, a graduate student in Reliance, S.D., and social services assistant at a behavioral health clinic on a reservation. She also noticed more articles encouraging users to get vaccinated. "It was like [the app was] kind of, like, more 'for it' — for pregnant moms getting vaccinated."
Hannah Hastings, head of brand and communications for Peanut, told The Post in a statement that it had removed the aforementioned anti-vax posts and banned their authors in line with its 2019 "Community Guidelines." Glow did not respond to a request for comment.
The experience of What to Expect shows that, when smaller apps do explicitly prioritize content moderation, the results can be striking.
What To Expect has "gradually redefined how we moderate posts about vaccines," Christine Mattheis, the site's vice president and editorial director, wrote in an email, as "vaccine misinformation has increased in our community during the COVID-19 pandemic."
In the past couple weeks, the omicron variant has increased the urgency of questions on the What To Expect discussion boards about getting vaccinations for both pregnant individuals and kids ages 5 to 11. Multiple users have recently posted asking for advice on whether to get a booster shot during pregnancy as an extra layer of precaution against omicron.
Any platform that allows users to interact or create content eventually will face questions about how to deal with offensive speech, said Evelyn Douek, a lecturer at Harvard Law School who researches online content moderation. Smaller sites tend to lack the resources to moderate users' discussions as effectively as the large platforms, she added, and can become hubs of misinformation.
On What to Expect, the community aspect is built into its identity — "word of mom" is how Murkoff, the author of the bestseller book, describes the way that users interact and support each other. "We have to give their worries a platform, without giving a platform to the misinformation that's fueling their worries," she said.
Part of a franchise built around the book series, What to Expect's "Pregnancy & Baby Tracker" projects scientific credibility and promises "thousands of medically accurate articles, plus stories from real parents and parents-to-be." It's part of a digital media group called Everyday Health Group, which also includes the parenting site BabyCenter, clinical news outlet MedPage Today and wellness brand DailyOm, among others. The group was acquired in 2016 by the New York-based digital media conglomerate Ziff Davis.
Like other pregnancy and parenting apps, What to Expect features community pages where expectant individuals can connect with others who share their interests, concerns, or due-date month. These were among the pages that users say became hotbeds of vaccine scare stories, conspiracy theories, and misinformation.
The app's "Top Stories" tab listed numerous, apparently professionally written articles, rooted in evidence, according to a search on the app for "vaccines" in October. There were official recommendations that the coronavirus vaccines were safe and effective for pregnant women and other pregnant individuals, with the benefits outweighing the risks. For example, one article was titled, "No evidence that Covid-19 vaccines increase miscarriage risk during pregnancy."
One swipe to the left, however — to the "Discussions" tab, or the chat forum — and things quickly got murky. A discussion page titled "Any moms not sure about Vaccines" touted "Doctor Paul Thomas's delayed vaccine schedule plan" for routine childhood vaccinations. The plan recommends "no vaccines" during pregnancy, skipping babies' vaccinations for Hepatitis B, Rotavirus, and IPV, among others, and makes the MMR vaccine optional. A respondent pointed out that Thomas had his medical license suspended for misleading patients about vaccinations; another replied, "That just makes me want to follow his vaccine schedule." Thomas didn't respond to a request for comment.
The majority of respondents were either supportive or sympathetic to skipping vaccines. Parents offered tips on how to find pediatricians who won't "push back," and what states allow vaccination exemptions for religion or personal belief.
A commenter identifying herself as a registered nurse wrote, "my baby is unvaccinated completely! She hasn't even had a needle touch her yet at almost two years old. Healthy as a horse." Numerous respondents cheered her on and said it was good to hear such reassurances from a nurse. One said she'd performed "too many autopsies on babies and small children... and noticed 'well child visit' in their history info within the last 14 days."
Conspiracies around the efficacy of vaccines long flourished on sites such as What to Expect. Many experts considered it a form of debate — that it was healthy to tolerate different viewpoints.
What made the debates feel high-stakes on the What to Expect app was that people were coming there undecided, asking questions and looking to the community to make up their minds, said Renee DiResta, research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory and an expert on digital communities. She used the What to Expect app when she had her first child years ago.
"Nobody believed they were going to change the mind of the diehards on either side of things," DiResta said. "But there were a lot of people who hadn't given a lot of thought to vaccinations prior to getting pregnant, because this is a major phase shift in their life. There's a major opportunity to reach people, because they're trying to make the best decision for their baby."
Most pregnant women can't realistically expect to be able to reach their doctors for reassurance every time they have a hyper-specific question or whenever something feels a little weird. But they can look to other moms, and often do, in places like What To Expect.
For Claire, a 32-year-old from New York City who works in film and is expecting her first child, that impulse to connect with other pregnant individuals proved powerful. (She spoke on the condition of only using her first name for fear of online harassment.)
Thrilled and nervous after a positive pregnancy test, Claire downloaded the app the same day. She followed prompts to join a forum for those with January due dates and began receiving daily automated email digests of the discussion threads.
She soon found, to her dismay, that the forum's top posts over the summer often included conspiracy theories about vaccines, including the covid-19 vaccines. Though Claire had resolved to get vaccinated before downloading What to Expect, she was afraid to click. She knew she was in a vulnerable state. She didn't trust herself not to get spooked.
The presence of anti-vaccine rhetoric wasn't entirely surprising to Claire, though it irked her that the app seemed to be "actively serving it to you without you looking for it" via the email digests. "What really pissed me off and alarmed me was people trading advice on how to get around vaccine mandates" at their workplaces and children's schools, she said. For example, in one thread that was served to her inbox, "Somebody who was pregnant but had other children was asking other moms for advice on how to forge vaccine documents for their kid's school."
The CDC's release of an official stance on vaccination during pregnancy was an inflection point for What To Expect. "We drew the hardest line when the CDC began explicitly recommending that pregnant people get vaccinated, and released a lot of data showing that not getting vaccinated is far more dangerous than the shot itself," Mattheis wrote.
What to Expect already had a policy against posts that contained blatant anti-vaccine disinformation. But it hadn't been as focused on enforcing it. And, as Mattheis noted, "the total volume of this violation type has risen so dramatically this year."
What To Expect has adopted a number of strategies to combat the proliferation of misinformation on the discussion pages, Mattheis said. First, What to Expect expanded its moderation staff's hours so that its nine moderators now work in shifts to ensure 24/7 coverage.
Mattheis also noted that the app developers built a keyword detector that would flag posts about vaccines for moderator review and invested in a third-party "abuse-detection service" to identify and flag potential misinformation. The company also adjusted its user interface to make reporting misinformation and guideline violations easier, adding "misinformation/conspiracy" to the list of violations that members can report.
The company regularly adds to its collection of "evidence-based, medically reviewed articles" about vaccines (including the coronavirus vaccine and routine childhood vaccinations), and adds video content featuring Murkoff talking to experts such as Anthony Fauci and CDC director Rochelle Walensky.
By late November, not one of the top 15 discussion threads under the "vaccines" search included conspiracy theories or evident covid-19 misinformation. One thread titled, "Theory: COVID Vaccine caused my miscarriage," raised questions about whether the vaccine could cause miscarriage. The majority of replies assured the original poster that it was most likely a coincidence. Several users noted that they had friends or relatives who had conceived successfully after vaccination, while others pointed out that miscarriages are common among the unvaccinated as well.
Still, of course, these measures are limited in their power to quash misinformation. Some posts slip through the filters. Not every post that should be flagged gets flagged; human moderators and AI detection systems both fail sometimes, or don't recognize and delete misinformation as quickly as would be ideal. Plus, Mattheis added, anti-vaccine activists often understand and successfully evade What to Expect's screening tools.
What to Expect's struggles with vaccine conspiracies make for "a fascinating case study," said Harvard's Douek. "It's a lot to expect from What to Expect to develop really sensitive and nuanced content moderation technology to distinguish lies from opinion from disinformation." Those kinds of issues can stymie even tech giants with vast resources, such as Facebook and Google's YouTube.
On the other hand, Douek added, niche apps may represent a more tractable moderation problem if people accept that they're not meant to be a public square for political speech.
"You have some sympathy for the people that run these platforms wanting to just provide a forum for people to discuss these issues," said Douek. "And then suddenly they're thrust into this unenviable role of deciding the boundaries of public conversation."

Full text: It's time for our roundup of the biggest Pinocchios of the year.
We have to admit we had been hoping that for the first time since 2014, Donald Trump would not make this roundup. "This may be Trump's last appearance on this annual list," we optimistically wrote a year ago. "As of Jan. 21, we will set a high bar for fact-checking his statements. He will be a defeated ex-president, and we tend to focus on claims made by people in power."
We kept our promise — we fact-checked him rarely — but his continuing lies about the election he decisively lost left us no choice but to reserve yet another spot for him. This marks a repeat appearance for this claim, as we had also put his false claims about the election on the list last year. Moreover, the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol was an extension of Trump's months-long campaign to delegitimize potential defeat. Astonishingly, the initial response by many Republicans — a moment of clarity and condemnation — soon gave way to Trump subservience yet again.
In compiling this list, which has no particular order, we mostly focused on claims that earned Four Pinocchios during the year. To keep it simple, in some cases, we have shortened or paraphrased the quotes in the headlines. To read the full column, click on the link embedded in the quote. The all-around categories have links within the summaries.
Continuing election lies
On Jan. 2, Trump called fellow Republican Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, and over the course of an hour spouted false claims in a vain effort to "find" enough votes to overturn his defeat in the state. President Biden's inauguration 18 days later did not stop Trump from continuing his effort, such as demands for new audits, to sow suspicion and mistrust among his supporters about the presidential election — or to ensure supporters are in place in key election roles if he decides to run again in 2024. In his speeches, Trump often focuses on swing states that he narrowly lost. He especially likes to overwhelm his listeners with details — usually irrelevant details — to leave an impression of an election system that is highly suspicious and fraudulent. Polls show Trump's campaign of election falsehoods is having an effect, undermining Americans' faith that votes will be counted correctly.
Jan. 6 falsehoods
The shocking Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters was followed quickly by false claims by Republicans to diminish the scope of the attack or deflect blame. Within hours, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and others blamed antifa forces for engineering the assault, despite no evidence. Trump falsely claimed that he "requested" 10,000 troops to protect the Capitol but that the request was rejected by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). (All he did was throw out a big number in a conversation with aides, based on an inflated idea that 1 million people would show up for his rally.) Meanwhile, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) falsely said Pelosi denied a request for National Guard troops. (Public testimony showed Pelosi did not even hear about the request until two days later.) Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) claimed, based on false social media reports, that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) had offered a "hoax" about her experience during the Capitol Hill riot.
" Georgia's new law ends voting hours early so working people can't cast their vote ."
Biden repeatedly condemned a new Georgia election law that imposed new restrictions on voting, but one of his complaints was simply false: "It ends voting hours early so working people can't cast their vote after their shift is over." Many listeners might assume he was talking about voting on Election Day. But Election Day hours were not changed. The law did make some changes to early voting. But experts say the net effect of the new early-voting rules was to expand the opportunities to vote for most Georgians, not limit them.
" In my race in 2018, they found 95,000 ballots after election night. "
Sometimes politicians keep repeating what we call zombie claims. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) for years has been alleging large-scale violations in Florida's 2018 election but has never coughed up the proof. He says 95,000 votes were found illegally after the polls closed in 2018. But the votes were always there and officials counted them before the legal deadline. Florida officials — at agencies led by Scott appointees — investigated his claims while he was governor and produced no evidence to support his flimsy and inflammatory charges.
Viral conspiracy claims about Biden
With a snip and clip, along with misleading labeling, opponents of Biden flooded social media with false claims. Three especially caught our attention. First, a viral tweet claimed that on Inauguration Day, "someone in Biden's earpiece told him to salute the Marines, and Biden just repeated the words 'salute the Marines,' because he is so used to just repeating what comes from his earpiece." (Actually, Biden remarked, "Good-looking Marines.") Then, on Fox News, host Tucker Carlson used a 2015 clip of then-Vice President Biden to claim Biden had some sort of secret plan to flood the United States with undocumented immigrants and accomplish what Carlson called "the great replacement" — what he describes as "the replacement of legacy Americans with more obedient people from faraway countries." But Carlson had snipped just half a minute from a six-minute Biden riff at a 2015 conference. The full remarks showed Biden was saying the opposite of what Carlson claimed. Finally, Biden was not silenced by mysterious aides with a "mute" button, despite energetic efforts by the Republican National Committee and Sen. James E. Risch (R-Idaho) to spread this rumor.
" Officials are handing out Kamala Harris's book to migrants "
The New York Post reported that a children's picture book written by Vice President Harris was being handed out in "welcome kits" to young migrants at a shelter in Long Beach, Calif. Fox News, which is owned by the same family as the New York Post, then amplified the story with its own version of the article. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel ran with these reports and posted critical tweets. But it turns out a single copy of the book, "Superheroes Are Everywhere," was donated by a member of the community. The New York Post withdrew its story after our fact check and the reporter resigned, tweeting she was ordered to write it.
Biden's Flights of Fancy
When the president veers from his prepared texts, we often end up with what we call a Biden original — an assertion with specific numbers that appears to have no source, such as a report in an academic journal or from a think tank, a congressional hearing or an expert's speech. During the year, we documented cases in which the president made puzzling statements for which there was no factual basis. He said that within 15 years, "every single" hospital bed would be filled with Alzheimer's patients. Experts were stumped by this statement and our calculations show that in 2040 there would still be plenty of hospital beds even with the anticipated increase in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Biden repeatedly said he has "traveled 17,000 miles with" Chinese leader Xi Jinping, a figure that could not be verified and made little sense. He said that the Second Amendment bars cannon ownership, which is flat wrong. He also falsely claimed that ending a minor tax break for racehorse owners would raise enough money — $9 billion — to cover free community college.
Ron Johnson's campaign of vaccine misinformation
Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) kept us busy this year with false or misleading claims about coronavirus vaccines. He said natural immunity is as strong if not stronger than vaccinated immunity. (Studies also show that the mRNA vaccines could better protect against new coronavirus variants than natural immunity.) He said there are serious side effects, including death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said at the time of our fact checks that "available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines," and now, based on further evidence, says, "A review of reports indicates a causal relationship between the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and TTS, a rare and serious adverse event — that causes blood clots with low platelets — which has caused or directly contributed to six confirmed deaths." But Johnson said more than 5,200 deaths had been reported in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. (That's a misuse of this data.)
" Glenn Youngkin took over a chain of dental clinics that performed unnecessary procedures on children ."
In his losing effort to regain the Virginia governorship, Terry McAuliffe (D) made flat-out false claims about his rival's business record in a debate and a campaign ad. Digging through corporate documents, we discovered that not only was Youngkin not part of the original transaction at his firm, Carlyle Group, but Carlyle did not own or manage the clinics; it merely helped fund the deal with loans. After problems at the clinics were exposed and the company failed to make good on its loans, in 2010 (before Youngkin became chief operating officer), the loans were renegotiated to give Carlyle a relatively small equity stake. Notably, in 2013, McAuliffe also earned a Biggest Pinocchio of the Year for a similar invented claim about his opponent during his successful run for governor.
" Only 11 percent of the money being wasted goes to real infrastructure. "
Despite his experience in the real estate business, Trump repeatedly failed to win approval of an infrastructure deal during his presidency. The $550 billion bipartisan package negotiated and signed by Biden has left Trump so disgruntled that he dismisses it as an "unfrastructure deal" in which only 11 percent of the spending goes to "real infrastructure." That's made-up math. More than one-third of the bill would qualify as infrastructure under the standards used by Trump during his presidency. But many more elements could be considered infrastructure, bringing the percentage as high as 80 percent.
Special hypocrisy award
In July, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) violated her own mask order, enacted in response to the delta variant of the coronavirus, while attending a reception after a wedding at which she officiated. A video emerged that clearly shows she was seated at a table, when the meal is over, despite her own mask mandate that said masks are not required indoors in these circumstances only when "actively eating or drinking." Rather than admit a mistake, she defended herself with partisan-laced spin and innuendo about "disinformation," making false accusations about the reporter who exposed her actions. (She lifted the order on Nov. 22, shortly before the omicron variant emerged.)

Full text: SEATTLE - Groups trying to discourage Americans from getting the coronavirus vaccine have raised tens of thousands of dollars for the efforts from Amazon.
AmazonSmile, a charitable-giving arm that donates a half-percent of every purchase from its online store to the nonprofit of a shopper's choice, gave more than $42,000 to a dozen anti-vaccine nonprofits last year, according a Washington Post analysis of its tax returns.
While it's a relatively small amount - particularly out of the more than $60 million it shared with nonprofits overall - these groups are able to stretch funds in large part thanks to the nature of spreading viral messages on social media, said Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, an advocacy organization that's focused on fighting vaccine misinformation.
"They are able to do a lot of damage with very little money," Ahmed said.
Even as Amazon has encouraged its workforce to get vaccinated, it will continue to fund groups that oppose vaccination, spokeswoman Stacey Keller said in an emailed statement.
"We respect that our customers have a wide variety of viewpoints on this matter, which is why the charities in question continue to be included in the list of organizations customers can choose from as part of AmazonSmile," Keller said.
(Amazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
Amazon has faced criticism for indifference to the promotion of coronavirus misinformation before. This past summer, Amazon customers posted reviews of ivermectin on the site that touted the horse dewormer as a covid-19 treatment, even as the Food and Drug Administration has warned against human use of the animal version of the product. And it has faced criticism for publishing books on the topic.
It's part of a larger issue of the tech giant's inability to control its platform, which has been plagued with issues including counterfeits and fake reviews as it pushed for bigger selection on its marketplace.
Founded in 2013, AmazonSmile lets almost all nonprofits participate, excluding those that are included on a list of hate groups from the Southern Poverty Law Center, as well as those on the list of groups suspected of ties to terrorism compiled by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. The groups must also qualify as a charitable organization, often called a 501(c)(3), with the Internal Revenue Service.
And according to the terms of AmazonSmile's participation agreement, Amazon says it won't give to organizations that "engage in, support, encourage, or promote … other illegal, deceptive, or misleading activities."
Keller declined to comment on whether the activities of the groups to which AmazonSmile is sending money are deceptive or misleading.
AmazonSmile, like other private foundations, is required to include a list of grants it gave on its tax returns, which are public. However, AmazonSmile's list of grants is more than 1,700 pages of tiny text that can't be searched with computer tools - and is sorted by the amount of the donation, not alphabetically, making it difficult to figure out how much was given to specific groups.
In total, AmazonSmile doled out $60.5 million in 2020 to about 300,000 groups including the American Red Cross, Nature Conservancy and the Wounded Warrior Project, according to its tax filing.
Some of the groups that oppose vaccines and government-mandated vaccinations actively pursue AmazonSmile dollars. The Web homepages for the National Vaccine Information Center and Physicians for Informed Consent include prominent messages encouraging visitors to shop at AmazonSmile, using the program's logo. AmazonSmile donations represent about 2 percent of total revenue for Physicians for Informed Consent, or $3,626, according to that group's tax filings.
AmazonSmile has faced previous criticism for funding controversial groups. In 2014, the Seattle Times reported that the program funded groups seeking to undermine lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality, even as the company offered benefits to same-sex partners of its employees and covered transgender surgical procedures. In 2019, the Guardian raised questions about the program funding anti-vaccination groups.
And last year, Popular Information, a newsletter, reported that Amazon had paid the National Vaccine Information Center $41,533 over several years through AmazonSmile, according to internal documents from the group it had obtained.
That group was again the biggest anti-vaccine beneficiary of AmazonSmile's largesse in 2020, receiving $12,675. That group laid out plans to sow distrust in coronavirus vaccines a year ago, before they became widely available.
Amazon also paid $10,969 last year to Children's Health Defense, a group founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that sued to block a D.C. law that allows minors to be vaccinated without their parents' knowledge.
Amazon gave Informed Consent Action Network, which offered legal support to challenge vaccine requirements this past spring, $2,970.41 in 2020.
Del Bigtree, the founder of the Informed Consent Action Network, falsely claimed that coronavirus vaccines - which had just begun to be distributed in the United States - were "dangerous" at a private October 2020 conference hosted by the National Vaccine Information Center and observed by researchers from the Center for Countering Digital Hate.
Other vaccine opponents at the conference promoted supposed alternative treatments, like inhaling hydrogen peroxide, which does not in fact treat the coronavirus and can be harmful.
And last winter, after Kennedy shared dubious claims about the coronavirus, Instagram permanently banned him for "repeatedly sharing debunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines," according to Raki Wane, a spokeswoman for Meta, the Facebook parent company that also owns Instagram.
AmazonSmile contributions to Informed Consent Action Network account for less than 0.1 percent of the group's annual budget, Bigtree said in an emailed response to questions. And Bigtree, who prefers the description "vaccine-risk aware" to "anti-vax," said there would be "no impact on ICAN if the AmazonSmile funds stopped."
In an email, Rita Scheffler, a spokeswoman for Kennedy's Children's Health Defense, called the group "a public interest organization that advocates for transparency and robust safety testing of vaccines and other medical interventions."
None of the other groups responded to requests for comment.
Contributions via the AmazonSmile program make up a few percentage points, at most, of the anti-vaccine groups' annual budgets, as reported in their tax filings.
Still, "Amazon is directly funding the disinformation that is being bombarded at people" and could endanger their lives, Ahmed said.
In an emailed response to an inquiry from The Washington Post, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called on Amazon to stop.
"Amazon has allowed COVID-19 misinformation to spread on its platform, while AmazonSmile is funding groups that spread dangerous COVID-19 and anti-vax misinformation," Warren said. "I've called on Amazon to use its power to stop it, but they refuse to act. Amazon must put public health ahead of profits - this needs to end now."
Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths persist nationwide as the country closes in on 50 million reported coronavirus infections since the start of the pandemic. Those infections are rising as nearly two-thirds of the country has received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine and more half the country is fully vaccinated, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

While it's a relatively small amount — particularly out of the more than $60 million it shared with nonprofits overall — these groups are able to stretch funds in large part thanks to the nature of spreading viral messages on social media, said Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, an advocacy organization that's focused on fighting vaccine misinformation.
"They are able to do a lot of damage with very little money," Ahmed said.
Even as Amazon has encouraged its workforce to get vaccinated, it will continue to fund groups that oppose vaccination, spokeswoman Stacey Keller said in an emailed statement.
"We respect that our customers have a wide variety of viewpoints on this matter, which is why the charities in question continue to be included in the list of organizations customers can choose from as part of AmazonSmile," Keller said.
(Amazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
Amazon has faced criticism for indifference to the promotion of coronavirus misinformation before. This past summer, Amazon customers posted reviews of ivermectin on the site that touted the horse dewormer as a covid-19 treatment, even as the Food and Drug Administration has warned against human use of the animal version of the product. And it has faced criticism for publishing books on the topic.
It's part of a larger issue of the tech giant's inability to control its platform, which has been plagued with issues including counterfeits and fake reviews as it pushed for bigger selection on its marketplace.
Founded in 2013, AmazonSmile lets almost all nonprofits participate, excluding those that are included on a list of hate groups from the Southern Poverty Law Center, as well as those on the list of groups suspected of ties to terrorism compiled by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. The groups must also qualify as a charitable organization, often called a 501(c)(3), with the Internal Revenue Service.
And according to the terms of AmazonSmile's Participation Agreement, Amazon says it won't give to organizations that in "engage in, support, encourage, or promote … other illegal, deceptive, or misleading activities."
Keller declined to comment on whether the activities of the groups to which AmazonSmile is sending money is deceptive or misleading.
AmazonSmile, like other private foundations, is required to include a list of grants it gave on its tax returns, which are public. However, AmazonSmile's list of grants is more than 1,700 pages of tiny text that can't be searched with computer tools — and sorted by the amount of the donation, not alphabetically, making it difficult to figure out how much was given to specific groups.
In total, AmazonSmile doled out $60.5 million in 2020 to about 300,000 groups including the American Red Cross, Nature Conservancy and the Wounded Warrior Project, according to its tax filing.
Some of the groups that oppose vaccines and government-mandated vaccinations actively pursue AmazonSmile dollars. The Web homepages for the National Vaccine Information Center and Physicians for Informed Consent include prominent messages encouraging visitors to shop at AmazonSmile, using the program's logo. AmazonSmile donations represent about 2 percent of total revenue for Physicians for Informed Consent, or $3,626, according to that group's tax filings.
AmazonSmile has faced previous criticism for funding controversial groups. In 2014, the Seattle Times reported that the program funded groups seeking to undermine lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality, even as the company offered benefits to same-sex partners of its employees and covered transgender surgical procedures. In 2019, the Guardian raised questions about the program funding anti-vaccination groups.
And last year, Popular Information, a newsletter, reported that Amazon had paid the National Vaccine Information Center $41,533 over several years through AmazonSmile, according to internal documents from the group it had obtained.
That group was again the biggest anti-vaccine beneficiary of AmazonSmile's largesse in 2020, receiving $12,675. That group laid out plans to sow distrust in coronavirus vaccines a year ago, before they became widely available.
Amazon also paid Children's Health Defense, a group founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that sued to block a D.C. law that allows minors to be vaccinated without their parents' knowledge, $10,969 last year.
Amazon gave Informed Consent Action Network, which offered legal support to challenge vaccine requirements this past spring, $2,970.41 in 2020.
Del Bigtree, the founder of the Informed Consent Action Network, falsely claimed that coronavirus vaccines — which had just begun to be distributed in the United States — were "dangerous" at a private October 2020 conference hosted by the National Vaccine Information Center and observed by researchers from the Center for Countering Digital Hate.
Other vaccine opponents at the conference promoted supposed alternative treatments, like inhaling hydrogen peroxide, which does not in fact treat the coronavirus and can be harmful.
And last winter, after Kennedy shared dubious claims about the coronavirus, Instagram permanently banned him for "repeatedly sharing debunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines," according to Raki Wane, a spokeswoman for Meta, the Facebook parent company that also owns Instagram.
AmazonSmile contributions to Informed Consent Action Network account for less than 0.1 percent of the group's annual budget, Bigtree said in an emailed response to questions. And Bigtree, who prefers the description "vaccine-risk aware" to "anti-vax," said there would be "no impact on ICAN if the AmazonSmile funds stopped."
In an email, Rita Scheffler, a spokeswoman for Kennedy's Children's Health Defense, called the group "a public interest organization that advocates for transparency and robust safety testing of vaccines and other medical interventions."
None of the other groups responded to requests for comment.
Contributions via the AmazonSmile program make up a few percentage points, at most, of the anti-vaccine groups' annual budgets, as reported in their tax filings.
Still, "Amazon is directly funding the disinformation that is being bombarded at people" and could endanger their lives, Ahmed said.
In an emailed response to an inquiry from The Washington Post, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called on Amazon to stop.
"Amazon has allowed COVID-19 misinformation to spread on its platform, while AmazonSmile is funding groups that spread dangerous COVID-19 and anti-vax misinformation," Warren said. "I've called on Amazon to use its power to stop it, but they refuse to act. Amazon must put public health ahead of profits — this needs to end now."
Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths persist nationwide as the country closes in on 50 million reported coronavirus infections since the start of the pandemic. Those infections are rising as nearly two-thirds of the country has received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine and more half the country is fully vaccinated, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And a CDC study published in September found that people who were not fully vaccinated this spring and summer were more than 10 times more likely to be hospitalized, and 11 times more likely to die of covid-19, than those who were fully vaccinated.

Full text: Only four more weeks in 2021. Where did the year go? We've got the latest on the coronavirus variant and an investigation into all of Trump's contacts between the time he tested positive for the coronavirus and was hospitalized in Walter Reed last fall. But first:
Medical boards are moving cautiously on doctors spreading vaccine misinformation State medical boards are fielding more complaints about false and misleading information during the pandemic, but only a minority have taken action against doctors.
That's the finding of a survey from the Federation of State Medical Boards, the umbrella organization for state medical boards, set to be released this week and shared early with The Health 202.
The group surveyed its 70 member boards in September and October.
More than two-thirds of the 58 boards that responded had seen an uptick in complaints.
A dozen boards, representing roughly 1 in 5 respondents, reported taking some sort of disciplinary action against doctors for spreading false or misleading information. (Some states have multiple boards because they have separate boards covering osteopathic doctors.)
Humayun J. Chaudhry, the president of the Federation of State Medical Boards, said the survey shows state medical boards are attentive to the issue, but he emphasized that the investigation takes time. Not all instances of potential misinformation are clear cut, doctors must be granted due process, and the board must hear all aspects of a case, Chaudhry said.
But…
Some critics want more done to keep doctors from spreading misinformation.
At a time when many Americans are willing to endorse conspiracies around the virus and top health officials are blaming misinformation for fueling vaccine refusal, there's a growing demand for medical boards to make sure the doctors they license aren't contributing to coronavirus misinformation. While only a small minority of doctors are actively spreading disinformation, experts argue that irresponsible doctors can have an outsize impact.
Misinformation from doctors can be particularly insidious because doctors can leverage the credibility of their professional association and often use highly technical language that is hard for the public to "debunk," according to Rachel Moran, a researcher at the University of Washington who studies coronavirus misinformation. 
"When encountering vaccine hesitancy our advice is usually to tell people to 'discuss concerns around the vaccine with their doctor' — but if your doctor is actively spreading misinformation then this trust is only going to cement your hesitancy," Moran said.
Warnings
Medical boards are threatening action.
In July, the Federation of State Medical Boards issued a statement warning that doctors who spread coronavirus vaccine misinformation risk disciplinary action, including the revocation of their license. Physicians, the statement said, have an "ethical and professional responsibility to practice medicine in the best interests of their patients," which is violated when they spread inaccurate information about the vaccines. They were soon followed by other certifying boards focused on specific specialties, including the American Board of Family Medicine, American Board of Internal Medicine and American Board of Pediatrics.
A handful of doctors have already lost their licenses:
The Oregon Medical Board revoked the license of a doctor who refused to follow public health guidelines in his clinic, spread misinformation about masks and overprescribed opioids.
A San Francisco doctor who promoted a false conspiracy linking covid-19 with 5G networks surrendered his license to California's medical board.
Rhode Island's Board of Medical Licensure suspended the license of a doctor who discouraged patients from getting the coronavirus vaccines.
Some researchers point to examples of doctors who have maintained — or even renewed — their licenses despite making dangerous statements about the virus.
Among them are Sherri Tenpenny — an Ohio-based licensed osteopathic physician and anti-vaccine advocate, who gained notoriety for claiming the coronavirus vaccines could leave people "magnetized" during testimony before the Ohio House of Representatives this summer  — and Rashid Buttar, a North Carolina osteopathic physician who has falsely claimed that coronavirus vaccines kill more people than covid-19. 
(A spokesperson for the Ohio Medical Board said the board cannot discuss confidential complaints but noted the board's renewal process is automated. A spokesperson for the North Carolina Medical Board also declined to comment on any ongoing complaints or investigations but said the board has taken action on two previous occasions against Buttar and that his current license is subject to certain restrictions. One of those occasions was for allegedly providing ineffectual treatments to cancer patients.) 
Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, an advocacy organization focused on misinformation, said doctors spreading disinformation need to lose their licenses.
​​"If the first rule of medical ethics is do no harm, how can they let people who've broken the prime directive continue [to practice]?" he asked.
Coronavirus
Trump may have left a coronavirus trail The week before Walter Reed: After President Trump first tested positive for the coronavirus, he came in contact with more than 500 people, either in proximity to him or at crowded events, not including rallygoers.
That's according to a deep dive on the days from that first positive test before Trump was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, The Post's Ashley Parker and Josh Dawsey report. 
The episode "reveals a president and chief of staff who took a reckless, and potentially dangerous, approach to handling the coronavirus, including Trump's own positive test," Ashley and Josh write.
The first test: Trump learned he tested positive for the coronavirus on Sept. 26, 2020. He was already aboard Air Force One, and headed to a massive rally in Middletown, Pa. — a stunning revelation his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, made in his book set to publish Tuesday and obtained by the Guardian.
A second rapid antigen test, which apparently used the same sample, came back negative. Per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, Trump should have then taken a more accurate PCR test to confirm whether he had covid-19.
Trump would go on to hold a massive rally in Middletown, Pa.; host an event for families who lost loved ones to military combat; debate Joe Biden; talk to reporters unmasked on Air Force One; and more. On Oct. 2, 2020, just before 1 a.m., Trump tweeted that he and Melania Trump tested positive. 
Four questions scientists are still racing to determine about omicron Scientists are urging patience as they rush to learn more about the omicron variant, The Post's Carolyn Y. Johnson and Joel Achenbach report.
Here's what scientists are watching: 
Will the new variant usurp delta? Researchers need two more weeks to see laboratory data and what the virus does on the ground, said John Mascola, director of the National Institutes of Health's Vaccine Research Center.
Will omicron dodge the immune system's defenses? A preprint from South Africa found evidence that reinfection may be far more common with omicron than with previous outbreaks, but it didn't shed light on their severity or how much protection the vaccines provide.
How transmissible is it? Some preliminary data from South Africa suggests that it could spread more easily than delta. One preprint suggests that omicron may have picked up a snippet of genetic code found in a virus that causes the common cold, which could make it more transmissible.
What's the variant's severity? It's still unclear whether omicron will cause more severe illness than other strains of the virus. Anthony Fauci, Biden's chief medical adviser, said on CNN on Sunday that the signs are encouraging but cautioned it was too early to draw firm conclusions.
Here's what else you need to know: The Biden administration is reevaluating its controversial decision to impose a travel ban on South Africa and seven other countries with the hopes of lifting it soon, Fauci said on CNN.
Data on vaccines for kids younger than 5 years old could come before the end of the year, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told NBC News.
The Minnesota man who contracted the omicron variant met up with 35 friends at a New York City anime convention. About half have tested positive for the coronavirus, our colleagues Lenny Bernstein, Frances Stead Sellers and Fenit Nirappil report.
A cyberattack took Maryland's health department offline this weekend, as officials investigate the scope of the incident, our colleague Dan Diamond reports.
Have you wondered what it's like to cover the coronavirus? Dan dishes all with Bryan Curtis in the latest episode of The Ringer's Press Box podcast.
State scan
Oklahoma has enrolled many more newly eligible for Medicaid than Missouri Voters in both Missouri and Oklahoma voted to expand Medicaid last year, but the experiences of the two Republican-led states have diverged widely since then, Kaiser Health News's Bram Sable-Smith reports. 
Oklahoma has enrolled more than 210,000 of some 215,000 newly eligible people.
Missouri, which has an estimated 275,000 newly eligible people, has enrolled fewer than 20,000.
Republican leaders in both states had resisted Obamacare's Medicaid expansion for years. But when Oklahoma voters approved the expansion, the legislature appropriated $164 million to fund it.
Applications opened up in June and 113,000 people were approved within a month.
In Missouri, in contrast, the legislature refused to fund the expansion, and the governor threatened to withdraw it.
Even when a judge in August ordered the state to start accepting applications, Missouri did not begin processing them until Oct. 1. The convoluted back and forth means many Missouri residents may not know they are eligible.
Daybook
Today: Biden will deliver remarks this afternoon about the drug pricing provisions included in Democrats' sprawling economic package.
Senate Democrats are slated to discuss the health provisions in Biden's economic package with the parliamentarian, who is the arbiter of what's allowed under the budget maneuver the party is using to pass the bill without any GOP votes. A Senate Democratic aide confirmed the news, which Politico first reported.
Wednesday: The House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee will hold a hearing on the future of biomedicine.
Thursday: The House Oversight and Reform Committee will discuss findings from its drug pricing investigation.

Republicans hamper Biden’s attempts to fight the pandemic — and then hammer him for its persistence

Full text: Nearly a year ago, with newly developed coronavirus vaccines just starting to be rolled out, I wrote that we were seeing a competition between two Americas: the "geniusocracy" that developed the vaccines in record time and the "idiocracy" that would refuse to take them. It is now sadly obvious that the idiocracy has won out — at a terrible cost.
This is evident in one simple yet staggering statistic: More Americans have already died of covid-19 in 2021 (391,000 and counting) than in all of 2020 (385,000). How is this possible, given the widespread availability of safe and effective vaccines? The problem is that only 59 percent of the U.S. population has gotten fully vaccinated. We lag behind countries that boast far less in the way of resources, such as Mongolia, Ecuador and Cuba, because about 113 million Americans ages 5 and up have not fully availed themselves of these lifesaving medical breakthroughs. Of that total, 78 million people have not gotten even one dose.
What are these vaccine refusers thinking? Do they not know or care that unvaccinated Americans are dying at 11 times the rate of the fully vaccinated? Yet roughly 40 percent of the population has refused to get fully vaccinated, leaving the whole country vulnerable to worrisome new variants such as omicron.
At one time, there was substantial vaccine resistance among minorities. But now, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, vaccination rates among Whites, Blacks and Hispanics are almost identical. There are still sizable gaps based on education and age: Older, college-educated people are more likely to get their shots than the younger and less educated.
But the biggest gap of all is political: 90 percent of Democrats are vaccinated vs. only 61 percent of Republicans. Fourteen of the 15 states with the lowest percentages of fully vaccinated residents have Republican governors. Even masking is controversial in red states. In Miami last week, an immunocompromised Lyft driver was startled and grateful to see me wearing a mask — unlike so many of his passengers.
The result is that Republican areas have been hit harder by the pandemic in the past year than the blue states in the Northeast where it first struck. A study of county-level data finds that "new cases are now running 2.78x higher per capita in the reddest tenth of the country than the bluest tenth."
Why would so many Republicans decide they need not get vaccinated? Because that is the message they are getting from their tribal elders. Fox News Channel, in particular, has become "covidiocy" central. It pumps out nonstop disinformation against vaccines even while enforcing a strict vaccine mandate of its own. (Employees must submit proof of vaccination or a daily negative coronavirus test to enter Fox's offices.)
Fox News and its Republican allies politicize every twist and turn of the covid saga. On Saturday, for example, the hosts of "Fox & Friends" reacted to news of omicron as if it were a Democratic hoax to justify "more lockdowns." Pete Hegseth said, "You can count on a variant about every October, every two years," suggesting that Democrats were inventing omicron for electoral advantage.
Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Tex.) — the former White House physician, if you can believe it — joined in the conspiracy mongering a few hours later. He tweeted: "Here comes the MEV — the Midterm Election Variant! They NEED a reason to push unsolicited nationwide mail-in ballots." Kari Lake, a GOP candidate for governor of Arizona, chimed in: "They are going to try and sell us new 'Variants' for the rest of our lives if we don't tell them to shove it."
The rush to dismiss omicron as a hoax is demented and depressing on multiple levels. It suggests that Republicans have learned nothing from their unwillingness to take covid-19 seriously in 2020 because they thought it would hurt President Donald Trump's reelection chances. But while Democrats benefited politically from Trump's calamitous mishandling of the pandemic, its persistence, with its attendant supply chain woes and surging inflation, is now hurting President Biden. Thus, it is malevolent idiocy to suggest that Democrats are hyping the omicron variant for nefarious ends.
Indeed, at the same time that Republicans fight vaccine mandates and continue to play down the risk of covid-19, they also shamelessly attack Biden for not ending the pandemic. "I took President Biden . . . at his word when he said he was going to get covid under control," said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). "Unfortunately, more Americans have died this year than last year under covid."
The Wall Street Journal editorial board sounded a similar note, complaining that "Mr. Biden had no plan to deal with the large numbers of vaccine holdouts." If only Biden could do something about the Journal's proprietors, who also control Fox! This is akin to an arsonist blaming the fire department of not doing a better job of fighting fires.
You would think that such a shameless ploy — hampering Biden's attempts to fight the pandemic and then hammering him for its persistence — could not possibly work. But in the idiocracy that America has become, this shameless and disingenuous argument could actually resonate.

As pandemic pounds Ukraine, desperate officials try to scare people into getting the jab: ‘We’ve stopped being nice,’ said the head of Ukraine’s Vaccination Information Center.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine's pandemic figures are scary: skyrocketing infections, record deaths and among the lowest vaccination rates in Europe. So officials decided to become scary themselves with an advertising campaign aimed at young people: If you're unvaccinated, you may die.
"Every day, there's a new record in deaths," a voice-over intones in one advertising spot being shown on nearly 30 local television channels. Over images of young people partying, working out and engaging in other everyday activities, different voices echo ideas among young people about their invincibility. "Everything's fine with my immune system." "I'm still too young." "It'll pass over me."
But those shots are spliced together with images of young people being put on oxygen and rushed into intensive care. A final shot shows a coffin being lifted.
"You can fool yourself, but not covid," the final message says.
The ad, and others like it, are a noticeable escalation in the government's struggle to get the upper hand on the pandemic. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has promised to accelerate the pace of vaccinations after months of a slower approach focused on rolling out the vaccination drive and delivering basic information on the range of vaccines in Ukraine: AstraZeneca, Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac.
"I ask everyone to switch off your social networks and turn on your brains," Zelensky said in recent comments to reporters. "We must get vaccinated. It's the only solution."
Ukraine is experiencing its worst coronavirus wave so far and one of the deadliest in Europe. Daily numbers among the population of around 40 million regularly exceed 20,000 infections and 700 deaths — well beyond the previous major outbreak this spring, when the daily figures were about 15,000 new infections and 500 deaths.
The World Health Organization has placed Ukraine at No. 3 in daily deaths, after the United States and Russia, and in the top 10 in daily infection numbers. On Thursday, the WHO said Europe is again a pandemic hot spot, with a more than 50 percent jump in coronavirus infections in the past month.
Among the countries considered the "most affected," Johns Hopkins University says, Ukraine has the eighth-highest number of deaths per 100,000 of population.
Hospitals in parts of the country are reporting a shortage of beds, and there has been difficulty meeting the demand for medical oxygen. On Oct. 25, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention moved Ukraine to Level 4, its highest risk category for countries.
Public health officials in Ukraine warn that the situation may worsen, with deaths predicted to surpass 1,000 per day in the coming weeks.
Central to officials' efforts is an all-out push to boost vaccination rates.
Between 20 and 25 percent of the population has been fully vaccinated, and the shots are free and easily available. Officials report that well over 90 percent of those hospitalized with covid-19 are unvaccinated.

One reason Ukraine's vaccination rates are so low: widespread anti-vaccine narratives and disinformation campaigns, many of which officials claim are being pushed from inside Russia.
Russian authorities deny that they are fomenting instability in Ukraine. But Ukrainian officials insist that this is part of multipart campaign by Moscow to undermine Ukrainian sovereignty. Kyiv calls it a "hybrid war" that has included Russia's internationally unrecognized annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and support for an armed, pro-Russian separatist effort in eastern Ukraine.
Recent messages that Ukrainian officials suspect have Russian links include conspiracy theories that the novel coronavirus is spread via 5G digital technology or by the billionaire Bill Gates, that the vaccines will cause genetic mutations or that Ukraine's response is proof that it is a failed state.
In March, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, in response to U.S. allegations that Moscow was spreading pandemic-related disinformation worldwide, said the claims were "absurd" and "have no basis in fact."
"Russia has never participated and does not intend to participate in such campaigns against other vaccines," he said. (Russia developed its own vaccines, led by Sputnik V.)
Ukraine's information campaigns in the spring and summer focused largely on spreading the word that coronavirus vaccines — which reached Ukraine relatively late — were available, and where and how they could be obtained.
Svitlana Kisilova, the head of Ukraine's Covid-19 Vaccination Communication Center, said she and her team recognized that they were not connecting with certain audiences. They began to shift their messaging in September.

"The anti-vaccine messages are more emotional and very blunt," said Kisilova, whose group helps coordinate the government's public outreach.
"We looked at our research and understood that what we were doing wasn't working for certain audiences," she added. "We've stopped being nice."
Ukrainians' resistance to vaccines has a long history. Many view any official directive with suspicion, after decades of governmental corruption and mismanagement. There also is a movement against more established vaccines, such as those for measles and polio, that predates the pandemic.
On Wednesday, health officials told the BBC Ukrainian service that five pediatric cases of polio had been diagnosed in southwestern Ukraine.
At the same time, however, the anti-vaccine narratives were taking root. Opinion polls over the summer showed a sharp drop in the number of people saying they were ready to receive vaccine shots, from more than 70 percent to fewer than 50 percent.
"The reasons [for the drop] were many — lack of trust, fear of after effects," said Andrii Sukharyna, a political analyst at Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation in Kyiv, which conducted the second poll.
"But there were also more hidden reasons, and these to a great extent were connected to Russian propaganda."

Full text: Baltimore attempts to bridge disparate views of coronavirus vaccination
BALTIMORE - While canvassing for a coronavirus vaccination clinic on Baltimore's Pennsylvania Avenue, James Green met a woman who chastised him for wasting his time.
"That's the White man's vaccine," she told him this summer. "They're trying to wipe us off the face of the Earth."
It wasn't the first time Green, 23, heard that sentiment in his role as a vaccine ambassador for the city health department. The west Baltimore resident said he understands where it's coming from.
"A lot of the hesitation is ingrained, even in my generation," Green said.
After the coronavirus vaccines became available, demand was initially strong, while supplies ran scarce.
Health officials knew that demand would ease and many people still would need convincing to get inoculated and help stop the pandemic. They launched a messaging campaign, including prominent Marylanders such as sports figures, celebrities, community leaders and politicians rolling up their sleeves and spreading the word that the vaccines were safe and effective for all.
Yet the number of people getting the shots now has dropped off. About 32 percent of the U.S. population hasn't been vaccinated, according to national data. And several studies found that those who remain hesitant, reluctant or dismissive about getting vaccinated were more likely to distrust institutions such as hospitals, government officials and the news media. That meant that they wouldn't necessarily respond well to messaging campaigns pushed out by recognized figures.
At the same time, disinformation and misinformation about the vaccines continued to circulate largely unchecked across the country, targeting individuals who remain unvaccinated or on the fence.
The Baltimore City Health Department and others are attempting to remedy the disparate views by deploying an army of "vaccine ambassadors" such as Green into neighborhoods and communities, redefining what a "trusted messenger" looks like and who qualifies as one.
These messengers - ranging from full-time students to retired adults - are tasked with communicating the benefits of coronavirus vaccinations to those they meet and sharing the information people need to make informed decisions.
The process is slow and time-consuming, but more one-on-one engagement will help dispel some of the myths and misconceptions standing in the way of eligible populations and the vaccines, said Kendra McDow, chief medical officer for the health department.
McDow said ambassadors answer any questions people have about the safety, development and efficacy of the vaccines. They don't, however, push the shots with anyone expressing reluctance.
She acknowledged that some of the distrust that exists in Baltimore and elsewhere is valid and stems from personal or historical examples of abuse in the medical system.
Since the city hired ambassadors, the percentage of vaccinated individuals has risen each week, she said. Ambassadors have logged more than 12,000 unique conversations with people since the program started over the summer, according to the latest figures from the department. That includes canvassing, setting up information tables, staffing events, and having conversations over the phone and text messages.
The city health department employs 88 ambassadors who work 15 hours a week at a rate of $20 an hour. They are employed through a contract the department has with Morgan State University that is expected to be covered by funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
"We know this is a marathon," McDow said. "It's slow and steady."
Green is a University of Maryland School of Nursing student who coordinates outreach to young men in Baltimore as part of the health department's VALUE ambassador program.
VALUE ambassadors - shorthand for Vaccine Acceptance and Access Lives in Unity, Education and Engagement - target a range of potential vaccine recipients, including young adults; pregnant and lactating individuals; older adults; members of Black, Latino and Orthodox Jewish communities; people experiencing homelessness; people with disabilities; and immigrants.
Green said vaccine hesitation among young men of color often correlates with age.
"The scary part about young people in that age range is that they don't do their research, and a lot of times it becomes, 'What did I hear on the street?' " Green said.
Young men who are a bit older, he said, tend to think they're invincible against the virus - a misconception fueled by the fallacy that covid-19 affects only older adults. Even as the delta variant increasingly sickens younger patients and sends more children to the hospital, many of the young men Green interacts with remain ambivalent about protecting themselves, he said.
"I think we're still stuck in that egocentric, 'Well, it won't happen to me,' attitude," said Green, a Morgan State University graduate.
While Green acknowledged that many young Black men have rejected his efforts, he has scored some wins. He said it helps that the ambassadors appear at the same time and same locations each week, which helps establish trust. For recurring clinics at Coppin State University and the Druid Hill Farmers Market, the ambassadors spread out on foot into the surrounding neighborhoods.
Green likened his group of vaccine ambassadors to "party promoters." But they can't each rely on a script to "promote" the clinics, he said. The conversations have to be personal, genuine and authentic.
"It's tricky, right? Because if you try to talk to someone about changing their behavior, even if they have a maladaptive thought process behind the change, it's not good for you to outright directly challenge that," he said. "Because once you [invalidate] someone's belief … they're going to stop listening to everything you say.
"So, I meet them in the middle. I say, 'Hey, I thought the same thing. I still have those reservations sometimes. But let me tell you something: This is not designed to hurt you. This is designed to help you.' "
When Kathleen Page left Latin America in the 1990s to study medicine in the United States, she figured she'd return south with her medical degree someday. But instead of going home, she settled in Baltimore and focused on serving the Latino community as an infectious-disease physician.
The associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine is one of more than a dozen ambassadors promoted by the state health department's GoVAX program. She spends two days a week visiting clinics throughout the Baltimore area, urging fellow Spanish speakers to get vaccinated. On a recent Sunday, Page brought her knowledge to Fiesta Baltimore, an annual celebration of Latino culture, in Patterson Park.
Page said most people she encounters through the state's outreach program eventually agree to get vaccinated. Many people have ill-informed perceptions about side effects they could experience after getting the shots, she said. Also, she has convinced pregnant people that the data overwhelmingly supports them getting vaccinated.
"Having a doctor that speaks Spanish is very, very reassuring to some people," said Page, whose family is from Uruguay. She distilled her philosophy to three pillars: "Right place, right time, right language."
Page estimates that about 10 percent of the people who refuse to get vaccinated do so because of religious beliefs. She doesn't try to talk them out of their convictions, she said. But she does answer questions and offers people the number for the coronavirus hotline of the Esperanza Center, an immigrant resource center, so they can talk it over further.
The more contagious delta variant, along with vaccine mandates in workplaces, have been motivating more people to seek out vaccinations, Page said. As the numbers continue to rise, she thinks more people will let their guard down and get the shots.
"The most influential thing is seeing others get vaccinated," Page said. "They saw their neighbors and friends get it, and they were fine."
Willietta Gombeh-Fonjungo has heard all the myths since joining Baltimore health officials in city neighborhoods through a program called Baltimore Health Corps: "The covid-19 vaccine makes you more sick than the disease." "It alters your DNA." "It tracks your whereabouts."
She spends her days delivering real information, and some reassurance, to people who remain hesitant to get vaccinated. The program is a ready force of about two dozen community health workers and supervisors. It's been trained with the assistance of Johns Hopkins University's Jhpiego, an international nonprofit health-care organization, and other groups.
The 24-year-old joined the effort not long after moving to Baltimore from New Jersey with her new husband and her new degree in public health. She was from a family of nurses and eager to get on the front lines - in this case outside, on sidewalks, in neighborhoods.
Now a site supervisor, she leads canvassing teams that hand out fliers about vaccination clinics, answer questions and debunk the persistent misinformation that keeps people from getting shots.
"The number one thing I do is dispel all of the things people hear," she said at a recent clinic at a city high school, where the inaccurate refrains were that the coronavirus doesn't infect kids or their cases are never that bad.
Gombeh-Fonjungo said she often visits the same places multiple times, approaching the same people, and she hopes, making them trust her.
She feels fulfilled each time it works, like when a security guard at a grocery store finally agreed to a shot.
She once approached a half-dozen men outside a library with a big smile and an offer to answer questions about the vaccine. All refused, though one said his mother wouldn't let him visit until he got a shot. Gombeh-Fonjungo asked whether he understood that his vaccination would protect her, too.
After some follow-up questions answered by a nurse, and Gombeh-Fonjungo offering to hold his hand through the process, the man not only got the shot, but talked another friend into doing it, too.
"It's become personal," she said. "We clap when people get vaccinated."

Full text: Breitbart is the most influential producer of climate change denial posts on Facebook, according to a report released Tuesday that suggests a small number of publishers play an outsize role in creating content that undermines climate science.
The far-right news and commentary site is one of just 10 publishers responsible for nearly 70 percent of interactions with climate change denial content on Facebook, according to a study by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), shared exclusively with The Washington Post. This group of publishers, nicknamed the "Toxic Ten" by the CCDH, includes organizations with links to foreign governments, such as RT, as well as with ties to fossil fuel giants, such as Media Research Center.
The report includes a broad range of climate disinformation, including articles that undermine the existence or impacts of climate change or misrepresent data in ways that might erode trust in climate science experts. This includes a Breitbart story published in March that suggested the Green New Deal, proposed legislation to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, is likely to result in mass lockdowns if passed into law.
"Every major environmental figure [and] climate activist has praised the COVID lockdowns as essentially a model for what we should be doing with climate," the article reads.
Breitbart, a Trump-aligned website once run by former White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon, has long held a close, controversial relationship with Facebook. The social network in 2019 faced criticism for including the website as a participant in its "News" tab, which curates national and local news stories and, in some instances, pays publishers. (The Washington Post was among the participating outlets).
A Facebook whistleblower in October told The Post on the condition of anonymity that Facebook executive Joel Kaplan, a former George W. Bush administration official, once defended a "white list" that exempted Breitbart and other select publishers from Facebook's ordinary rules against falsehoods. Kaplan told The Post there has "never been" a white list that exempts publishers, including Breitbart, from the company's misinformation rules.
Breitbart, the Federalist Papers and Media Research Center did not respond to requests for comment.
The study comes amid increasing political concern about the catastrophic impact of climate change, as global leaders gather in Glasgow for the United Nations-brokered COP26, described as a last chance for nations to hammer out a unified plan to significantly cut greenhouse gases.
While the report doesn't provide a comprehensive look at all misleading climate change content promoted on Facebook, it has the potential to inspire political action as the CCDH has historically captured policymakers' attention. The nonprofit's March "disinformation dozen" report about top spreaders of anti-vaccine content was repeatedly cited by the White House along with numerous lawmakers in Congress, and it was used as a proxy for questions about the role of social media in aggravating vaccine hesitancy.
"When you put it all together, you've got these two industries, Big Oil and Big Tech, and they are the two industries that pose the greatest threat to the survival of our species," said Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the CCDH.
Earlier this year, Facebook promised to start adding informational labels to some climate posts, much like it does with election or coronavirus posts. But CCDH researchers found that of the posts they surveyed containing climate misinformation, just 8 percent carried Facebook's informational label.
The company contests the sample size of the CCDH's report, which looked at about 7,000 climate change denial articles published between October 2020 and October 2021 and observed more than 700,000 interactions on these posts, a sample Ahmed called "robust" enough "to derive representative findings of trends."
In a statement, Facebook spokesman Andy Stone called the methodology "flawed," arguing that the study represents just 0.3 percent of the "over 200 million interactions on English public climate change content from Pages and public groups over the same time period."
Facebook similarly pushed back on the structure of the CCDH's disinformation dozen report, arguing it was based on "narrow data" that wasn't representative of the hundreds of millions of posts that people shared about coronavirus vaccines on Facebook.
Callum Hood, the CCDH's head of research, said this data about climate change denial, collected using NewsWhip, which gathers information from Facebook's API, or application programming interface, is the best available to outside researchers, given the closed nature of the platform.
On Monday night, Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president for global affairs and communications, touted the company's commitment to addressing climate change, announcing an expansion of its climate change-centered informational labels to more than a dozen countries and plans to offer its climate science information center to more than 100 countries. Clegg added that Facebook reduces distribution of posts that its third-party fact-checkers say are false and recently activated a feature to make it easier for its partners to quickly find content related to COP26.
For years, Facebook has faced pressure to issue a broad ban on climate misinformation, but it has focused instead on boosting authoritative content on the issue. In September 2020, the company announced the creation of a "Climate Science Information Center" to connect users with science-based information, similar to a center it launched promoting authoritative information about the coronavirus. In February, Facebook announced it had started adding labels to some climate posts in Britain, directing people to the center. It expanded those labels in May to several countries, including the United States.
Yet amid these changes, posts that deny the existence of climate change were still attracting an audience on the Facebook. One November 2020 post from the Federalist Papers, a conservative news site, falsely says the Biden administration's commitment to climate action is "all based on a lie." It linked to an article saying climate scientists shouldn't be believed.
It's difficult to set up a query about climate change denial that would give a comprehensive view of all the problematic content on Facebook, said Bret Schafer, a senior fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a nonpartisan think tank that studies foreign policy and disinformation. The CCDH compiled its selection of articles using combinations of search terms, like "climate" and "alarmism," or "global warming" and "fraud," according to the study's methodology. Such a query could miss some of the articles about anti-climate science circulating on Facebook, according to Schafer, who added that making "sweeping" conclusions using a small subset of content would make him "nervous."
"It just seems it's a very tough world to wrap your arms around," he said. "There's just a lot that you are not going to capture there."
Ahmed said in a statement that the CCDH focused its research on the "most harmful commonly-circulated terms and tropes of climate denial," adding that many of the "mechanisms used to drip feed confusion and denial into the climate debate" are not accessible because of Facebook's closed API.
In a statement, Anna Belkina, RT's deputy editor in chief, said the publication doesn't "shy away from tackling the global concern of climate change, nor would we disregard the variety of views essential to a healthy public discourse on its effects."
Environmental experts say posts promoting the idea that climate change is a hoax could be an impediment to garnering public support for regulations to reduce emissions. Such falsehoods could be "highly corrosive" to efforts to craft necessary public policy, said J. Timmons Roberts, a professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University.
"Even just slowing down our actions and keeping us in the status quo is deadly," he said.
The report also takes aim at the ways publishers financially benefit from climate change denial content. The researchers estimate that during the past six months, the eight publishers that carry Google ads in this group have generated $5.3 million in Google ads revenue - earning the sites $3.6 million and Google $1.7 million.
Google announced in October that it would prohibit publishers and YouTube creators from monetizing content that "promotes climate change denial," company spokesman Michael Aciman said in a statement. But it hasn't taken effect yet. The company has previously enacted similar bans on advertising against harmful debunked claims or pandemic misinformation.
The report is already sparking backlash on Capitol Hill, amid growing scrutiny of the role that Facebook plays in amplifying disinformation and divisive content.
"Facebook and other social media companies make money when they send users down rabbit holes of climate change denial," Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said in a statement to The Post about the report. "That's a very dangerous business model for the future of the planet."

"When you put it all together, you've got these two industries, Big Oil and Big Tech, and they are the two industries that pose the greatest threat to the survival of our species," said Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the CCDH.
Earlier this year, Facebook promised to start adding informational labels to some climate posts, much like it does with election or coronavirus posts. But CCDH researchers found that of the posts they surveyed containing climate misinformation, just 8 percent carried Facebook's informational label.
The company contests the sample size of the CCDH's report, which looked at about 7,000 climate change denial articles published between October 2020 and October 2021 and observed more than 700,000 interactions on these posts, a sample Ahmed called "robust" enough "to derive representative findings of trends."
In a statement, Facebook spokesman Andy Stone called the methodology "flawed," arguing that the study represents just 0.3 percent of the "over 200 million interactions on English public climate change content from Pages and public groups over the same time period."
Facebook similarly pushed back on the structure of the CCDH's disinformation dozen report, arguing it was based on "narrow data" that wasn't representative of the hundreds of millions of posts that people shared about coronavirus vaccines on Facebook.
Callum Hood, the CCDH's head of research, said this data about climate change denial, collected using NewsWhip, which gathers information from Facebook's API, or application programming interface, is the best available to outside researchers, given the closed nature of the Facebook platform.
On Monday night, Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president for global affairs and communications, touted the company's commitment to addressing climate change, announcing an expansion of its climate change-centered informational labels to more than a dozen countries and plans to offer its climate science information center to more than 100 countries. Clegg added that Facebook reduces distribution of posts that its third-party fact-checkers say are false and recently activated a feature to make it easier for its partners to quickly find content related to COP26.
For years, Facebook has faced pressure to issue a broad ban on climate misinformation, but it has focused instead on boosting authoritative content on the issue. In September 2020, the company announced the creation of a "Climate Science Information Center" to connect users with science-based information, similar to a center it launched promoting authoritative information about the coronavirus. In February, Facebook announced it had started adding labels to some climate posts in Britain, directing people to the center. It expanded those labels in May to several countries, including the United States.
Yet amid these changes, posts that deny the existence of climate change were still attracting an audience on the Facebook. One November 2020 post from the Federalist Papers, a conservative news site, falsely says the Biden administration's commitment to climate action is "all based on a lie." It linked to an article saying climate scientists shouldn't be believed.
It's difficult to set up a query about climate change denial that would give a comprehensive view of all the problematic content on Facebook, said Bret Schafer, a senior fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a nonpartisan think tank that studies foreign policy and disinformation. The CCDH compiled its selection of articles using combinations of search terms, like "climate" and "alarmism," or "global warming" and "fraud," according to the study's methodology. Such a query could miss some of the articles about anti-climate science circulating on Facebook, according to Schafer, who added that making "sweeping" conclusions using a small subset of content would make him "nervous."
"It just seems it's a very tough world to wrap your arms around," he said. "There's just a lot that you are not going to capture there."
Ahmed said in a statement that the CCDH focused its research on the "most harmful commonly-circulated terms and tropes of climate denial," adding that many of the "mechanisms used to drip feed confusion and denial into the climate debate" are not accessible because of Facebook's closed API.
In a statement, Anna Belkina, RT's deputy editor in chief, said the publication doesn't "shy away from tackling the global concern of climate change, nor would we disregard the variety of views essential to a healthy public discourse on its effects."
Environmental experts say posts promoting the idea that climate change is a hoax could be an impediment to garnering public support for regulations to reduce carbon emissions. Such falsehoods could be "highly corrosive" to efforts to craft necessary public policy, said J. Timmons Roberts, a professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University.
"Even just slowing down our actions and keeping us in the status quo is deadly," he said.
The report additionally takes aim at the ways publishers financially benefit from climate change denial content. The researchers estimate that during the past six months, the eight publishers that carry Google ads in this group have generated $5.3 million in Google ads revenue — earning the sites $3.6 million and Google $1.7 million.
Google announced in October that it would prohibit publishers and YouTube creators from monetizing content that "promotes climate change denial," company spokesman Michael Aciman said in a statement. But it hasn't taken effect yet. The company has previously enacted similar bans on advertising against harmful debunked claims or pandemic misinformation.
The report is already sparking backlash on Capitol Hill, amid growing scrutiny of the role that Facebook plays in amplifying disinformation and divisive content.
"Facebook and other social media companies make money when they send users down rabbit holes of climate change denial," Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said in a statement to The Post about the report. "That's a very dangerous business model for the future of the planet."
It's also caught the attention of policymakers in Europe, who said the report should be a "wake-up call" to social media companies.
"They need to abide by their own policies and stop profiting from misinformation, which could literally end up costing the Earth," said Lord Jonny Oates, spokesperson for energy and climate change for the British Liberal Democrats who served as chief of staff to Clegg when he was deputy prime minister.

Full text: To overcome covid-19, at least 80 percent of Americans need to be vaccinated. We are now at 54 percent. Voluntary efforts have proved to be insufficient. It is inevitable we will need another mandate — this time for domestic travel by planes, trains and buses.
Although vaccine hesitancy is at least partially the product of a unique moment of disinformation and polarized politics, what we are witnessing is not unusual. Appealing to people's better nature has rarely persuaded 80 percent of Americans to do the right thing, even when the benefits are obvious. While World War II had overwhelming popular support, we needed a military draft because there weren't enough volunteer soldiers. Similarly, we have requirements and enforcement throughout society — laws against drinking and driving, for wearing a seat belt, for mandatory schooling that includes required childhood immunizations, obtaining consent before sex — because we can't count on voluntary compliance.
President Biden has mandated coronavirus vaccines for many Americans because persuasion has been insufficient to get vaccine uptake to 80 percent. But as welcome as the president's measures were, they will not be enough. Mandating vaccinations for flying and other forms of interstate travel is now critical if we are to prevent a predictable surge of infections and deaths during the coming winter holiday periods.
Last year, AAA estimated that 50 million Americans would travel over Thanksgiving, while more than 80 million would do so in the Christmas and New Year period. About 9.5 million people took flights at Thanksgiving, and about 10.2 million flew in the days around Christmas. The outcome was huge surges in infections, reaching 3,500 deaths per day by January — more than the number of Americans killed on 9/11.
Last year's winter holiday travel occurred largely before vaccines were available to the public. This year, many more people are expected to travel, especially by flying. A large proportion of these travelers will be highly vulnerable to infection and disease, because nearly 80 million American adults remain unvaccinated, and 48 million children younger than 12 are not yet eligible for vaccines. The only way to avert a repeat of last winter's carnage is a substantial increase in vaccinations and rigorous enforcement of mask mandates both for adults and children.
It takes roughly six weeks from the first shot for maximal protection to kick in. That is why the Biden administration must announce a travel mandate now so that more Americans are protected by Thanksgiving. If proving one's vaccination status were required to board a plane or take an interstate train or bus, many vaccine-refusing Americans would face a choice between remaining unvaccinated and being able to travel conveniently. Unvaccinated members of Congress may elect to thumb a ride home to Florida for the holidays, or arrange for a chauffeur to drive them from the Capitol to Georgia. But others may decide it's finally time to do the right thing and take advantage of these safe, free and effective vaccines, and encourage their constituents to do the same.
Requiring vaccination for travel is hardly radical. The U.S. government has been considering a mandate for people flying into the United States from foreign countries. It's already required for Americans to fly internationally if they don't want to quarantine for 10 or more days in Germany, Britain and other destinations. These policies have allowed international travel to resume. More than a month ago, Canada announced a vaccine mandate for interprovincial travel on all forms of public transport. We should follow our neighbor's lead.
Such a mandate would be straightforward to create, based on protecting federal employees from the infection risks created by unvaccinated travelers. Transportation Security Administration staff are exposed daily to thousands of unvaccinated people who pass through security checkpoints.
Of course, there will be pushback. But cries of "freedom" and "personal choice" are hollow and politically motivated. Our freedom is not unlimited. We live in a society of "ordered liberty" with reasonable restrictions on our conduct. We all have responsibilities to the well-being of others; never is this moral imperative more important than during a pandemic. Vaccination protects not just ourselves but others we come into contact with, including young children, cancer patients and other immunocompromised Americans who cannot be vaccinated themselves. Should we just ignore their rights to live safely?
There is a short window to boost coronavirus vaccination rates to make interstate travel safer. Introducing mandates today will reduce infections and, most importantly, hospitalizations and deaths in November and beyond. The Biden administration must act now to avert the mass death we saw last winter, especially as we battle the more transmissible delta variant. By giving unvaccinated Americans tougher choices about their movement and daily lives, we may finally have the lever we need to increase vaccination rates and turn the corner in this pandemic.

Full text: Here’s what you need to know at the end of the day.
(Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up .)
Good evening. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday.
1. The hotter-than-normal conditions that have contributed to severe drought across much of the Western U.S. show no signs of stopping.
Five states had their warmest June through August in 127 years of record-keeping. Two of those states — California and Oregon — experienced some of the largest wildfires in their history. Now, federal scientists have forecast that October will bring above-normal temperatures across the country, with only the Pacific Northwest and the Gulf States likely to have near-average temperatures.
If that forecast holds, the withering drought will most likely expand eastward into eastern New Mexico, eastern Colorado, and nearly all of Texas, Oklahoma and Nebraska. Much of the East Coast and the Upper Midwest are expected to be wetter than normal as well.
In other climate news, a House panel widened its inquiry into disinformation by oil giants after a secret video recording released in July exposed an Exxon official boasting of such efforts. Tomorrow, President Biden will host leaders to discuss climate change ahead of a U.N. summit.
2. Beijing and Paris responded with anger after Australia announced a military partnership with the U.S. and Britain that allows it to send submarines to monitor China’s actions in the South China Sea.
French officials accused President Biden of acting like his predecessor, saying they were not consulted about the deal and describing the decision as a “knife in the back.” France also canceled a gala that was meant to celebrate its relations with the U.S. The Biden administration said it had not told French leaders beforehand because it was clear that they would be unhappy with the deal.
Australia bet the house on U.S. power in Asia, our correspondents write in a news analysis. When Prime Minister Scott Morrison came to power, he insisted that his country could maintain close ties with China while working with the U.S. But after years of worsening relations with Beijing, the country is forging a “forever partnership” with Washington, its main security ally.
3. Thousands of Afghans remain on American military bases across the U.S. and overseas, weeks after their dramatic escape from Kabul.
Nearly 49,000 are living on eight domestic military bases, according to a document obtained by The Times. Roughly 18,000 are on bases overseas, largely in Germany. Some will leave within weeks; most will stay longer. Many Afghans who left the country in August were waiting for medical and security screenings and for flights that have been halted by a measles outbreak.
Our reporter visited rural Afghanistan, where the remnants of war are everywhere. But for the first time in years, the shooting has stopped.
4. Will the bus driver ever come?
Just weeks into the new year, school districts across the U.S. are desperate to fill jobs, especially positions behind the scenes — cafeteria workers, bus drivers and substitute teachers. But low pay, erratic schedules and Covid-19 fears are keeping workers away. The shortages have affected families, already under stress.
In other coronavirus news:

- Aides at U.S. nursing homes — who provide the most direct care to residents — were the least likely to be vaccinated, a study shows.

- Idaho will allow overwhelmed hospitals across the state to ration care if necessary.

- Public health experts in Africa called for the U.N. to speed up the delivery of coronavirus vaccines. Only 3.6 percent of people on the continent have been fully inoculated.



5. The South Carolina lawyer whose wife and son were mysteriously fatally shot was arrested after he admitted to staging his own murder.
Alex Murdaugh was charged with insurance fraud and conspiracy to commit insurance fraud and with filing a false police report in connection with the suicide scheme, which his lawyers said was meant to ensure a $10 million life insurance policy payout. He continued to deny any role in the deaths of his wife and son in June.
The series of stunning developments brought intense scrutiny to the prominent Murdaugh family and to three other deaths that took place in proximity to the family in recent years.
Separately, a young couple left for an adventure in their outfitted van. Now, the police say, the woman is missing and her fiancé is a “person of interest” in her disappearance.
6. “It’s always going to haunt me.”
Capt. Carneysha Mendoza, a commander with the Capitol Police, was at home when she started getting frantic calls about violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6. She raced to the scene and fought a pro-Trump mob for hours, suffering chemical burns to her face.
For those present, this moment of national crisis was also a deeply personal trauma. Here are some of their stories.
The “Justice for J6” rally for suspects involved in the Jan. 6 riot is scheduled for Saturday at the foot of Capitol Hill. Wary of the political fallout, Republican lawmakers are steering clear of the event.
In other news out of Washington, a Justice Department special counsel scrutinizing the Russia investigation secured an indictment against a lawyer at a firm with Democratic ties.
7. As internet titans enact privacy changes , a battle is intensifying that will reshape the future of the web.
The struggle has entangled Apple, Google and Facebook, upended Madison Avenue and disrupted small businesses. It previews a profound shift in how people’s personal information may be used online, with sweeping implications for the ways that businesses make money digitally.
At the center is the internet’s lifeblood: advertising. The technology behind “cookies,” which track people from site to site, is being dismantled. The fallout may hurt brands that rely on targeted ads to get people to buy their goods, and instead, drive money to Big Tech.
Here’s what the privacy battle means for you.
8. A political thriller by Hillary Clinton and Louise Penny. A Korean murder mystery. An investigation of lawbreaking animals.
Fall is book publishing’s biggest season, and this year our Books team published their first-ever fall preview: 20 new works of fiction; 11 nonfiction must-reads; new biographies and memoirs from prominent figures and celebrities; books on current affairs; and more. You can find all the recommendations here.
As readers rushed to buy books about race and racism after last summer’s protests, publishers raced to sign deals to publish more. Now, some of those books are starting to come out. Agents, authors and publishers are eager to see how these titles do.
9. Many of the best trees will be showing off their colors soon. But the best aren’t always the biggest.
Between the low ground cover and the tall canopy trees is a layer gardeners often forget about. Our garden columnist spoke to Marc Wolf, the executive director of Mountain Top Arboretum in Tannersville, N.Y., about the “native trees for the observant” that can fill that space.
If you’re outside in New York City and the surrounding region, be on the lookout for the beautiful spotted lantern fly — and kill it immediately. This invasive pest from Asia zealously feeds on the sap of more than 70 plant species, leaving them susceptible to disease and destruction.
10. And finally, good vibes on three wheels.
Parking enforcement vehicles are best known for ferrying dreaded parking police around cities. But a few dozen San Franciscans are reclaiming some of these three-wheelers for transportation and personal expression: decking them out in fanciful colors (blue and pink) as well as disco balls and faux fur.
The vehicles have a distinct practical advantage. Three-wheelers are legally classified as motorcycles, so they can be parked perpendicular to the curb. Outrageous decorations are a necessity — the cars are an instant magnet for the wrath of disgruntled passers-by — and most owners wisely stay off the highway. But they offer a bit of “creativity in the way we move in the world,” Jennifer Devine said.
Have a whimsical night.

Fall is book publishing’s biggest season, and this year our Books team published their first-ever fall preview: 20 new works of fiction; 11 nonfiction must-reads; new biographies and memoirs from prominent figures and celebrities; books on current affairs; and more. You can find all the recommendations here.
As readers rushed to buy books about race and racism after last summer’s protests, publishers raced to sign deals to publish more. Now, some of those books are starting to come out. Agents, authors and publishers are eager to see how these titles do.
9. Many of the best trees will be showing off their colors soon. But the best aren’t always the biggest.
Between the low ground cover and the tall canopy trees is a layer gardeners often forget about. Our garden columnist spoke to Marc Wolf, the executive director of Mountain Top Arboretum in Tannersville, N.Y., about the “native trees for the observant” that can fill that space.
If you’re outside in New York City and the surrounding region, be on the lookout for the beautiful spotted lantern fly — and kill it immediately. This invasive pest from Asia zealously feeds on the sap of more than 70 plant species, leaving them susceptible to disease and destruction.
10. And finally, good vibes on three wheels.
Parking enforcement vehicles are best known for ferrying dreaded parking police around cities. But a few dozen San Franciscans are reclaiming some of these three-wheelers for transportation and personal expression: decking them out in fanciful colors (blue and pink) as well as disco balls and faux fur.
The vehicles have a distinct practical advantage. Three-wheelers are legally classified as motorcycles, so they can be parked perpendicular to the curb. Outrageous decorations are a necessity — the cars are an instant magnet for the wrath of disgruntled passers-by — and most owners wisely stay off the highway. But they offer a bit of “creativity in the way we move in the world,” Jennifer Devine said.
Have a whimsical night.

Full text: Will a new governor bring new priorities?
New York after Cuomo
Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s bombshell resignation yesterday, under a barrage of sexual harassment allegations, has upended politics in New York.
The news was notable for many reasons, not least that Cuomo was a purported supporter of the #MeToo movement. (In his resignation speech, the governor took responsibility for his actions but denied ever touching anyone inappropriately.) For more on how “the Cuomo story demonstrates the durability of the movement,” read The Times’s Jodi Kantor in our sister newsletter The Morning.
When Cuomo steps down in two weeks, the lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, will step up, becoming the first woman to occupy New York State’s top office. For the state with the country’s financial capital, a new leader has implications for business, too.
On the pandemic. Amid a resurgence of coronavirus cases, up nearly 90 percent in the state over the past two weeks, how Hochul addresses vaccine mandates, mask rules, testing and related measures will be closely watched by companies rethinking their own policies, in New York and the country as a whole. Cuomo left broad mask and vaccine mandates up to city and local governments to decide, but Hochul hasn’t said whether she would do the same. She has backed keeping schools open and in person.
On big business and Wall Street. Cuomo had his enemies on Wall Street, some dating back to his time as attorney general after the financial crisis. “Ding, dong, the witch is dead,” tweeted Steve Rattner, one of those foes. But Cuomo’s focus on financial support for ambitious real estate projects, charter schools and other initiatives won support from business leaders. Before becoming lieutenant governor, Hochul did a stint in government relations at M&T Bank.
On taxes. Hochul has generally positioned herself as a small-tax Democrat, campaigning to cap property taxes and saying that the federal government’s removal of the state and local tax deduction is unfair to New York.
The unanswered questions. There are pending infrastructure projects, like a controversial plan to build an AirTrain to La Guardia Airport, that Hochul may manage differently than her predecessor. But the biggest question circulating last night among some big Democratic donors was about who will run for governor in 2022. Hochul? Bill de Blasio? Letitia James? Hakeem Jeffries? Hillary Clinton? For the business lobby, there isn’t a clear choice yet, but the suddenly open race is set to dominate discussion.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
The Senate passes a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. The bipartisan bill, which passed with 69 votes yesterday, would be the biggest allocation of federal funds to roads and bridges and other projects in more than a decade. Then, around 4 this morning, the chamber passed a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint along party lines. Both measures now go to the House.
Inflation is set to come in hot. A report due today is expected to show another big gain in prices in July, probably around 5.3 percent, complicating Fed policy and posing a political liability for the Biden administration’s expansive spending plans.
Coinbase rides cryptomania to a $1.6 billion quarterly profit. The nearly 4,900 percent year-on-year rise in profit shows that building a large — and profitable — cryptocurrency exchange is possible. “Crypto has arrived,” Coinbase wrote to shareholders, in its second earnings report as a publicly traded company.
Dominion wages war on far-right news media over disinformation. The voting machine company that became a target of baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential vote is seeking $1.6 billion in damages in each defamation lawsuit filed against Newsmax, One America News and Patrick Byrne, the former C.E.O. of Overstock. The company previously started proceedings against Fox News, Rudy Giuliani, the MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell and the pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell.
Instagram rolls out new features to combat racism, as Facebook faces criticism for inaction. English soccer officials waged a two-year campaign to pressure Facebook and other social media companies to do more to prevent online abuse of players, with insufficient results, according to sources and internal documents obtained by The Times. The changes to Instagram, introduced today, makes racist material harder to view.
Robinhood’s push to ‘democratize finance’ takes shape
Robinhood, the popular trading app for small investors, is acquiring Say Technologies, which specializes in digitizing shareholder votes, for $140 million.
Many retail shareholders don’t vote, buying shares but then not exercising their power to have a say on things like executive pay packages and who sits on a company’s board. Nell Minow, a shareholder rights and corporate governance expert, said that making it easier for Robinhood’s users to vote their shares could shake up corporate boardrooms just like when millions of traders used the app to send meme stocks soaring this year.
“Robinhood was at the kindergarten stage when it came to democratizing Wall Street, and this moves it up to at least the first year of high school,” Minow said. Individuals acting together could compel companies to take the lead on environmental and social justice issues, she said.
But small investors tend to side with management more than institutional investors do , said Jonathon Zytnick, a research fellow at the Institute of Corporate Governance and Finance at N.Y.U. Law School. “Voting methods matter a ton getting retailer shareholders to vote,” Zytnick said. “And retail investors can perform a monitoring role, but at least right now, it is almost certainly wrong to think of this as a means of environment and social change.”
But if there’s anything that the past few months have taught us, the behavior of big crowds of small investors is hard to predict.
Vaccine mandates, four ways
Companies are increasingly mandating coronavirus vaccines for their employees. This is legally allowed, and has been held up in court challenges. But for various reasons, not all employers have applied blanket mandates. Here are four of the common approaches that have emerged:
Microsoft requires vaccines for all U.S. employees. The tech company, which employs roughly 100,000 people in the U.S., said in early August that it would require proof of vaccination for all staff, vendors and guests to enter its offices.
Walmart requires vaccinations for some, but not all, of its employees. The country’s largest private employer mandates vaccines for office workers at its headquarters and for managers who travel in the U.S., but not for the majority of its employees, who work in its stores and warehouses.
Delta Air Lines requires vaccinations for new hires. It is unclear how many workers this policy will ultimately affect. The airline industry, like others, is facing a labor shortage.
JPMorgan Chase encourages, but does not require, vaccinations. Until recently, this approach was the default, with companies offering incentives for vaccination, such as cash bonuses, instead of mandates. On Friday, JPMorgan announced that unvaccinated employees would be required to complete coronavirus tests twice a week.
Lawmakers laser-eye the crypto crowd
The $1 trillion infrastructure bill passed in the Senate yesterday includes a tax-reporting provision that cryptocurrency supporters fought to remove, generating multiple amendments and lots of headlines. But those changes got blocked, and the original language in the bill survived, which defines “broker” for the purposes of crypto transactions in an overly broad way, according to detractors.
The crypto lobby, having mounted a spirited but unsuccessful campaign, vowed to use its power to fight another day, on the tax provision as well as other challenges to its industry, like increased scrutiny from the S.E.C.
“In my view, the legislative priority should center on crypto trading, lending and DeFi platforms,” Gary Gensler, the S.E.C. chair, said in a letter released today by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts. She had asked him about the risks of decentralized finance, or DeFi, a booming, $80 billion sector that eliminates middlemen from financial transactions through automation. Gensler echoed the remarks he made in a straight-talking speech this month laying out his priorities for regulating the “Wild West” crypto industry.
The S.E.C. chief is also worried about “stablecoins.” The market in these tokens pegged to the dollar or other currencies is worth about $115 billion, Gensler noted, and last month, nearly three-quarters of all trading on crypto platforms involved stablecoins. This “may facilitate those seeking to sidestep a host of public policy goals connected to our traditional banking and financial system: anti-money laundering, tax compliance, sanctions and the like,” he wrote.
The fight over the tax provision in the infrastructure bill was an “amuse-bouche,” said Miller Whitehouse-Levine, the policy director of the DeFi Education Fund, a new nonprofit initiative dedicated to this sector. Crypto supporters realize that they will have to “educate” officials in Washington and beyond, Whitehouse-Levine said.
The infrastructure bill is now with the House, where there is another chance to change the tax provision, though there’s no path to an amendment yet, said Perianne Boring of the Chamber of Digital Commerce. Assuming passage, the I.R.S. would write detailed guidance before the law goes into effect in 2023, and the crypto industry’s arguments reflected in the legislative record could influence the agency’s interpretation. In the meantime, as Gensler’s letter suggests, the industry’s growing might will invite additional scrutiny.

Full text: with Mariana Alfaro
Welcome toThe Daily 202 newsletter! Tell your friends to sign up here. On this day in 1974, Richard Nixon's presidency ends, effective at noon Eastern time under the terms of his resignation letter.
As Congresssoonheads home for the August recess, it looks like neither party is especially eager totalkto voters aboutthe pandemic. Theirreluctancecomesevenas cases and hospitalizations soar and thedelta variantis nowcentral to high-profile skirmishes between the White House and Republicans.
PresidentBiden promisedvoterstwo main thingsin2020:Tosmother the pandemicandrevivethe economy. But the viral summer surge — just weeks after he invited Americans to celebrate a "summer of freedom"fromthecoronavirus — hasgreatlycomplicated his political messaging.
Among Republicans, meanwhile,somenationally prominent governorswho rode resistance to expert health advice about the pandemic,like Ron DeSantisof Florida,suddenly find themselvesoverseeing record hospitalizations, making their past triumphalismat bestan uncertain betforthe future.
The midterms are an eternity awayin political terms.
The two sides of America's partisan divide are sure to reject and adopt slogans and strategies over the course of the next 15 months. And Biden, unlike the average member of Congress, will have no choice but to run on his handling of the pandemic.
But for now, it's striking that one of the main features of life —apandemicthathas killed more than 616,000 people in America— seems toberecedingfrom the congressional political messaging.Again: For now.
My colleague Paul Kanereported on Saturday:
"On Tuesday, three Democratic political committees unveiled a plan for how to sell President Biden's agenda to their constituents, with just three bullet points: middle-class tax cuts; an infrastructure plan to create jobs; and lower health-care costs.
Democratic pollsters tested 150 different messages near the end of July with voters in six battleground states, finding that one theme stood out as the overwhelming winner with voters:'Cutting taxes for middle class families, creating jobs by investing in infrastructure like roads, bridges andhigh speedInternet, and cutting your health care costs. No one making under $400,000 will pay more taxes.' "
In the original Democratic Senate Campaign Committee document, the pitch concludes: "… but Republicans are standing in the way of these proposals because they are looking out for wealthy special interests."
(Wait, 150 different messages?!?)
Paul went on to note House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has told Democrats to hold home-state events promoting the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package passed this Spring, "with a heavy focus on a new child tax credit that gives families up to $300 a month per child."
What about Republicans? At Axios,Stef W. Kight and Alayna Treeneconsider "Inflation, rising crime and the border surge are positioning Republicans for even bigger midterm gains than they'd imagined just months ago."
They quote Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), the chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, as saying:"This administration has mismanaged the economy, mismanaged the border, mismanaged crime in the cities, and people are noticing and are very disturbed by it. Take a look at any of the poll numbers."
We will in a second, but note what’s not in those talking points: The pandemic.
Paul, of course, did look at the polls.
"According to a CNBC poll released Tuesday, just 42 percent of voters approve of the president's handling of the economy, down from 46 percent earlier this year, and his handling of the pandemic has had a corresponding drop: 53 percent of voters support his coronavirus work, down from 62 percent.
In late July, the Gallup poll showed Biden's overall job performance falling slightly among Democrats, but down seven percentage points among independents, to 48 percent."
Where falling case numbers and hospitalizations seemed likeanedge for Democrats just a few months ago,my colleagues Sean Sullivan and Marianna Sotomayorreported this weekend on increasing unease inside the party.
"Democrats had hoped to pivot from Biden's  success on the pandemic to pitch the party's economic agenda, including sweeping proposals on infrastructure and social programs. But the rise in covid-19 cases is suddenly complicating that strategy. …
Democrats have also begun saying more directly that it's Republicans who are prolonging the pandemic, while they are urgently trying to end it.President Biden and his aides are criticizing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for example, for opposing mask mandates in schools, a switch from their previous reluctance to stoke fights with Republicans over the coronavirus. The House Democrats' campaign arm is encouraging candidates to call out Republicans for making false or misleading statements about vaccines and masking.
Meanwhile, Republicans, after largely avoiding the subject of the pandemic for much of this year, have begun going after Biden's handling of it, saying he'spiked the football'prematurely and asserting, with little evidence, that a surge of migrants at the border is fueling the spread of the virus."
In both cases, party politics are complicated by the way unvaccinated Americans have made it possible for the Delta variant to rip through parts of the country.
Historically, the president's party loses seats in its first midterms.Democrats hope to hold on totheswing voters—notably women, notably in America's suburbs—that gave them their narrow congressional majority. Republicans see opportunity in a political map showing the GOP did well in 2020 at every level — except the presidential race.
And neither, at least in August 2021, seems eager to talk about the pandemic.
What’s happening nowDemocrats released a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint as the Senate prepares to finish the bipartisan infrastructure debate.
"Senate Democrats released a sweeping $3.5 trillion budget blueprint [this morning] that proposes to expand Medicare, boost federal child care and education programs, and invest new sums to combat climate change, as party lawmakers prepare to take the next step toward advancing central elements of President Biden's economic agenda," Tony Romm reports.
"Democrats view the wide array of proposed spending as historic, and they hope to rely on their narrow but potent majorities in Congress to grow government to a level not seen in decades. The measure also proposes universal pre-kindergarten, reform of federal immigration laws and fresh efforts to lower prescription drug prices, marking fresh attempts on Capitol Hill to adopt long-stalled priorities and campaign promises from the 2020 presidential election."
"In releasing the document, Democratic leaders pledged their package would be financed in full, chiefly through tax increases targeting corporations and wealthy families — all the while leaving untouched Americans making less than $400,000 annually in keeping with Biden's pledge. Like much of the budget, however, it ultimately leaves the work to draft those provisions to other lawmakers and committees."
"Once the package is complete, Democrats plan to shepherd the new spending through Congress using a process known as reconciliation."
"The new budget outline complements the roughly $1.2 trillion infrastructure proposal that the chamber is on track to pass by Tuesday morning."
"The Senate's outline — chiefly drafted by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the chairman of the Budget Committee — essentially opens the door for Democrats to seek many of the proposals Biden put forward this past spring as part of his families and jobs plans. Republicans had derided many of these initiatives as social spending, which they argued at the time did not belong in an emerging deal over new investments in the country's roads, bridges and pipes."

Lunchtime reads from The Post
"Mississippi's history of lynching haunts,"by DeNeen L. Brown: "Around midnight on Feb. 8, 2018, a 21-year-old Black man was found hanging from a pecan tree in the front yard of his White girlfriend's home on a dirt road in Scott County, Miss. Willie Andrew Jones Jr. was dangling from a twisted, yellow nylon rope attached to a low tree branch. ... The 10 adults who were inside the house that night told inconsistent stories of what happened before and after Jones was found hanging, according to police statements and court records. Documents show that 40 minutes after Scott County Sheriff's Department investigators arrived at the house, they declared Jones's death a suicide. But Jones's mother, Tammy Townsend, 45, disputes the department's quick conclusion. She believes her son was lynched. The stories didn't add up, she said. Jones and his girlfriend, Alexis Leann Rankin, had a 4-month-old boy, who was inside the house that night. Minutes before Jones was found, he had argued with his girlfriend and her White stepfather, who disapproved of interracial relationships and had threatened him with a gun ... Since 2000, according to police records, at least eight Black men have been found hanging from trees in Mississippi — plus Craig Anderson, who was fatally beaten in a racial terrorist attack that a federal judge called a lynching. Although authorities have ruled the deaths suicides, many relatives believe their family members were slain."
"Pace of Taliban advance quickens as militants overrun three major cities in a single day,"by Susannah George: "Taliban fighters overran three major cities in the north of Afghanistan on Sunday, the most significant territorial gains the militants have netted in a single day since the withdrawal of U.S. forces entered its final phase this year. In nearly simultaneous operations, the Taliban pushed into the center of Kunduz city and the capitals of Sar-e Pol and Takhar provinces. Afghan officials said clashes were continuing in Kunduz, and a major military operation was planned to retake the strategically important city that the militants had besieged for months. The developments marked a sharp escalation in the pace of Taliban gains across Afghanistan."
… and beyond
Rise of cash buyers across Nevada's housing market leaves conventional homebuyers locked out,"by the Nevada Independent's Tabitha Mueller: "Across the state, an increasing number of cash purchasers — including investors, investment pools, larger corporations and wealthy buyers from out of state — are driving up the pressure and squeezing out would-be purchasers reliant on loans and mortgages."
"Three more House reps have broken the law by failing to properly disclose their financial trades,"by Business Insider's Dave Levinthal and Warren Rojas: "Rep. August Pfluger, a Republican from Texas, was several months late disclosing several stock purchases or sales made in January or March either by himself or by his wife. The total value of the trades fell between $10,007 and $150,000 ... and include transactions involving shares of Bank of America Corp., Liberty Media Corporation [and] Wells Fargo ... Rep. Cheri Bustos, a Democrat of Illinois, sold up to $150,000 worth of stocks last March. That liquidation included dumping up to $50,000 worth of stock in the online retailer Amazon [among others] ... Rep. Steve Chabot's (R-Ohio) latest financial disclosures show he exchanged up to $30,000 worth of stock in the pharmaceutical companies Allergan PLC and AbbVie Inc. last spring."
The environmentHumans have pushed the climate into an “unprecedented” territory, warns a landmark U.N. report.
"More than three decades ago, a collection of scientists sanctioned by the United Nations first warned that humans were fueling a dangerous greenhouse effect and that if the world didn't act collectively and deliberately to slow Earth's warming, there could be 'profound consequences' for people and nature alike. The scientists were right," Brady Dennis and Sarah Kaplan report. "On Monday, that same body — the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — issued its latest and most dire assessment about the state of the planet, detailing how humans have altered the environment at an 'unprecedented' pace and cautioning that the world risks increasingly catastrophic impacts in the absence of rapid greenhouse gas reductions."
"The landmark report, compiled by 234 authors relying on more than 14,000 studies from around the globe, bluntly lays out for policymakers and the public the most up-to-date understanding of the physical science on climate change. ... Monday's sprawling assessment states that there is no remaining scientific doubt that humans are fueling climate change. That much is 'unequivocal.' The only real uncertainty that remains, its authors say, is whether the world can muster the will to stave off a darker future than the one it already has carved in stone."
"Humans can unleash less than 500 additional gigatons of carbon dioxide — the equivalent of about 10 years of current global emissions — to have an even chance of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. But hopes for remaining below that threshold — the most ambitious goal outlined in the Paris agreement — are undeniably slipping away."
"Each of the past four decades has been successively warmer than any that preceded it, dating to 1850. Humans have warmed the climate at a rate unparalleled since before the fall of the Roman Empire. To find a time when the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere changed this much this fast, you'd need to rewind 66 million years to the meteor that killed the dinosaurs."
The Dixie Fire has mushroomed in the second-largest wildfire in California history.
The fire has reached more than 489,200 acres, Hannah Knowles reports. "The fire razed most of Greenville late Wednesday and continues to threaten nearly 14,000 buildings, firefighters said, underscoring the danger of climate change-fueled disasters. Most of California's biggest wildfires on record have erupted in the past year, as dry conditions and high temperatures lead to destruction, mass evacuations and smoke disrupting life in the West. On Sunday, authorities said they were trying to keep Dixie's flames from reaching homes in the tiny community of Crescent Mills, just a few miles south of Greenville."
"As evacuation orders expand, they have been warning of unusually fast-spreading flames and 'historically' low moisture levels leaving land primed to burn."
Thousands fled the Greek island of Evia by boat as “horror-movie” wildfires rage.
"More than 2,000 people on the Greek island of Evia were force to evacuate by boat over the weekend as raging wildfires continued to spread, wiping out homes, reducing once-picturesque landscapes to ashes and destroying entire villages. Photos showed devastated residents standing under amber skies amid searing heat as they waited to be rescued from the island, which is Greece's largest by area and population after Crete. Elderly members of the community were carried to safety, as other locals walked along the roadside to find help," Jennifer Hassan reports.
"Greek officials said that at least 570 firefighters were working to bring the fires under control, which were triggered by the country's worst heat in 30 years — a consequence of a warming planet."
The pandemicDeSantis’s battle against mask and vaccine mandates approaches a boiling point in Florida.
"His ban on vaccine passports was temporarily blocked by a federal judge late Sunday: Norwegian Cruise Line was cleared to require coronavirus vaccines for guests and crew members after U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams granted the company a preliminary injunction, blocking a Florida law championed by DeSantis that would have fined the cruise company for requiring vaccines," Bryan Pietsch, Adela Suliman and Hannah Knowles report.
"DeSantis has rejected coronavirus restrictions or mandates as a greater threat than rising infections fueled by the highly transmissible delta variant. Florida is the epicenter of a summer coronavirus spike in the United States, recently reporting a fifth of all new U.S. infections and current hospitalizations. ... The pressure from courts, schools and companies leaves an uncertain path forward for how coronavirus policies could play out in Florida."
The variant battle in the United States is over. Delta won.
"Since late last year, the country has been overrun by a succession of coronavirus variants, each with its own suite of mutations conferring slightly different viral traits. For much of this year, the alpha variant — officially known as B.1.1.7 and first seen in the United Kingdom — looked like the clear winner, accounting for the majority of cases by April. In second place was iota, B.1.526, first seen in New York City. A few others made the rogue's gallery of variants: gamma, beta, epsilon," Joel Achenbach, Carolyn Johnson, Lena Sun and Brittany Shammas report. "Then came delta — B.1.617.2. It had spread rapidly in India, but in the United States, it sat there for months, doing little as the alpha advanced. As recently as May 8, delta caused only about 1 percent of new infections nationally. Today, it has nearly wiped out all of its rivals."
"Epidemiologists had hoped getting 70 or 80 percent of the population vaccinated, in combination with immunity from natural infections, would bring the virus under control. But a more contagious virus means the vaccination target has to be much higher, perhaps in the range of 90 percent. Globally, that could take years. In the United States, the target may be impossible to reach anytime soon given the hardened vaccine resistance in a sizable fraction of the country, the fact that children under 12 remain ineligible and the persistent circulation of disinformation about vaccines and the pandemic."
Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) rallied behind parents resisting a mask mandate. Then some tried to depose their school board.
"Coronavirus cases are on the rise among children in North Carolina, where Cawthorn slammed a county's new school mask mandate, calling the measure 'psychological child abuse,'" Jonathan Edwards reports. "The board had voted earlier that day to require unvaccinated students and teachers to wear masks while inside or on buses when school starts later this month. The conservative firebrand's comments were met with applause."
"Stephanie Parsons later told the board she would not leave the meeting until its members reversed its mask mandate. Board members did not meet her demand. Parsons was part of a group that forced the school board into recess by disrupting the regularly scheduled meeting. She and others then 'overthrew' the board and instated themselves as the new leaders of the county's public education system."
Quote of the dayHot on the left
The New York attorney general's report concluding Gov. Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed 11 women has led to fallout at Time's Up and the Human Rights Campaign."The boards of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay-rights group, have launched an independent investigation of the group's president [Alphonso David] for his role advising Cuomo's staff during their efforts to undermine the credibility of a woman who had accused him of sexual harassment," Michael Scherer and Josh Dawsey report. "Separately, the chairwoman of the Time's Up, Roberta Kaplan, stepped down from the organization, which advocates for survivors of sexual harassment and abuse, amid a growing backlash about the role she played consulting with Cuomo staff on the same effort. ...
"The developments come after the abrupt resignation Sunday night of Cuomo's top aide, Melissa DeRosa. A person close to DeRosa, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe her thinking, said the longtime Cuomo adviser did not believe the governor could survive politically, and that she had reached a 'breaking point.' The person said that Cuomo remained defiant and did not plan on resigning, and that DeRosa's resignation should not be seen as a harbinger of his thinking."
More on the Cuomo investigation:
Cuomo's executive assistant described escalating misconduct that was "certainly not consensual."The assistant, Brittany Commisso, told "CBS This Morning" and the Albany Times Union that she remained silent about a series of unwelcome sexual advances because she was scared of getting fired, John Wagner reports. "These were not hugs that he would give his mother or, you know, his brother," Commisso said of Cuomo. Commisso was previously identified only as "Executive Assistant #1" in the report. Last week, Commisso filed a criminal complaint against Cuomo with the Albany County Sheriff's Office, alleging that Cuomo groped her breast in the governor's mansion in Albany. Cuomo has denied the allegations.
Kathy Hochul, New York's lieutenant governor, is quietly preparing to step into the limelight,writes the New York Times's Dana Rubinstein. "If the governor steps down or is forced out, Ms. Hochul, 62, will take his place, becoming the first woman to lead New York State — a remarkable rise for someone who has largely toiled in obscurity since joining the governor's team in 2014. ... [Hochul] has established deep reservoirs of political good will, spending much of her tenure on the road, highlighting the administration's agenda and engaging in extensive on-the-ground politicking. She has taken pride in visiting each of New York's 62 counties each year and has friends across the state."
Hot on the right
"In western New York, the far right tries to make inroads with vaccine skeptics,"Razzan Nakhlawi writes: "Far-right groups across the nation have aligned themselves with those opposed to masks and vaccines, seeking new allies around the issue of 'medical freedom' while appearing to downplay their traditional focus on guns, belief in the tyranny of the federal government and calls by some for violent resistance. Public health mandates and the push to vaccinate as many people as possible against covid-19 have become animating issues for patriot groups, which have long held conspiratorial views of the federal government. ... At a moment when domestic extremism has been identified by the FBI as the major violent threat in the United States and lawmakers are focused on the fallout from the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, researchers and health experts are increasingly concerned about the alliance forming nationwide between the radical right and vaccine-hesitant populations."
A bigger, bluer Northern Virginia, visualized
The populous northern suburbs of Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William counties — crucial to a statewide win —backed Bob McDonnell in 2009. But in the dozen years since, Northern Virginia has become much bigger and bluer, posing a daunting challenge to any Republican running statewide.

Back-to-school is already here
A number of public schools in Atlanta and its suburbs reopened today, ushering in the back-to-school season as the Delta variant surges.
Several school districts in the South will soon follow suit where Covid cases are on the rise, including Alabama, Texas, Louisiana and Florida. They will be an early test case in what is a near-universal push by school districts to bring back in-person learning after a devastating 2020-21 school year.
“Every school district that I speak to is planning for a full reopening,” said Dana Goldstein, who covers education for The Times. “But the Delta variant has definitely tamped down on optimism about a so-called return to normalcy.”
The decentralized U.S. school system means there are large differences among schools’ plans and virus precautions, like mask wearing, social distancing and vaccination requirements for teachers and staff.
Adding to the confusion, some states have banned schools officials from imposing mask mandates. But some school districts in those states are imposing mandates anyway.
With the highly contagious Delta variant, Dana said, “I think it’s not realistic to not expect cases in schools. So I’ll be watching how schools decide to react.”
One charter school in Georgia, which reopened last week, has already had to quarantine some 278 students, faculty and staff. The school had tested 1,900 students in the week before school started; masks were required, as were social distancing and regular temperature checks. But as of Thursday afternoon, 19 students and seven staff members had tested positive for the virus.
The White House, worried about lagging vaccination rates among young people, today unveiled a new push to get eligible students their shots. The plan includes enlisting pediatricians to incorporate vaccination into back-to-school sports physicals and encouraging schools to host their own vaccination clinics.
Parents, meanwhile, say they are facing a tough choice: send kids to school and risk infection, or keep kids home and jeopardize their mental health and educational development.
As schools forge ahead, many parents are wondering how they can safely send their children back to the classroom. My colleague Tara Parker-Pope answered some common questions.
How can it be safe for children to go back to classrooms during a pandemic?
Surprisingly, schools have not been a major cause of Covid spreading events, particularly when prevention measures are in place. A combination of protections — masking indoors, keeping students at least three feet apart in classrooms, keeping students in separate cohorts or “pods,” encouraging hand washing and regular testing, and quarantining — have been effective. The American Rescue Plan also allocated $122 billion to help school districts pay for safety measures, and the C.D.C. has allocated $10 billion for testing.
What are the risks of Covid-19 and the Delta variant to children?
Overall the news is reassuring. New research suggests the Delta variant may cause more serious illness in adults, but it’s not known if the variant puts children at greater risk. Compared with adults, children diagnosed with Covid-19 are more likely to have mild symptoms or none at all, and are far less likely to develop severe illness, be hospitalized or die from the disease. Out of about 3.5 million cases of Covid-19 in children in the U.S., 519 have died from Covid-19 (fewer than 0.015 percent).
What should parents do if their school district doesn’t have a mask policy?
The C.D.C. has said mask mandates in schools are associated with a roughly 20 percent reduction in Covid-19 incidence. But even in schools with mask mandates, compliance by children is never 100 percent. Parents in school districts without mask mandates should learn what other steps are being taken, including regular testing and ventilation measures. Parents can ask their children to wear masks in schools, but masking is far less effective if most kids aren’t doing it.
What precautions can we take at home to lower a child’s risk?
The most important step is to vaccinate everyone in the family as soon as they are eligible. This will lower the risk of a child getting infected at home and protect family members if a child brings the coronavirus home from school. In addition, everyone in the family should get flu shots this fall and make sure other vaccines are up-to-date. Paying attention to the community transmission and vaccination rates and wearing masks in risky settings can also help.

Louisiana’s “darkest days”
Louisiana has emerged as a coronavirus hot spot, with the highest per capita rate of cases in the country and a beleaguered health care system straining to keep up.
The state is averaging more than 4,300 cases a day, according to New York Times data, and hospitals are overflowing with more Covid patients than ever before. Intensive care units are packed in many hospitals, including those serving children.
“These are the darkest days of our pandemic,” said Catherine O’Neal, the chief medical officer at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge.
If there’s a bright spot among the surge, it’s that demand for coronavirus vaccines has nearly quadrupled in recent weeks in the state, providing a promising glimmer that the deadly reality of the virus might break through a logjam of misunderstanding and misinformation.
But it takes time for vaccines to bolster immune systems, and the state could still be weeks away from relief.
Vaccine rollout

- Los Angeles is considering a proposal that would require proof of vaccination in many indoor public spaces, The Los Angeles Times reports.

What you’re doing
I am so mentally and emotionally exhausted at this stage of the pandemic that when my 5-year-old recently came down with fever, sore throat and runny nose, I took him to get tested and was almost hoping it was Covid and that the mild symptoms we were all experiencing would be our way out of this cycle of anxiety. It was negative. I did feel relieved but it continues to lurk around the corner and almost feels inevitable.

Back-to-school is already here
A number of public schools in Atlanta and its suburbs reopened today, ushering in the back-to-school season as the Delta variant surges.
Several school districts in the South will soon follow suit where Covid cases are on the rise, including Alabama, Texas, Louisiana and Florida. They will be an early test case in what is a near-universal push by school districts to bring back in-person learning after a devastating 2020-21 school year.
“Every school district that I speak to is planning for a full reopening,” said Dana Goldstein, who covers education for The Times. “But the Delta variant has definitely tamped down on optimism about a so-called return to normalcy.”
The decentralized U.S. school system means there are large differences among schools’ plans and virus precautions, like mask wearing, social distancing and vaccination requirements for teachers and staff.
Adding to the confusion, some states have banned schools officials from imposing mask mandates. But some school districts in those states are imposing mandates anyway.
With the highly contagious Delta variant, Dana said, “I think it’s not realistic to not expect cases in schools. So I’ll be watching how schools decide to react.”
One charter school in Georgia, which reopened last week, has already had to quarantine some 278 students, faculty and staff. The school had tested 1,900 students in the week before school started; masks were required, as were social distancing and regular temperature checks. But as of Thursday afternoon, 19 students and seven staff members had tested positive for the virus.
The White House, worried about lagging vaccination rates among young people, today unveiled a new push to get eligible students their shots. The plan includes enlisting pediatricians to incorporate vaccination into back-to-school sports physicals and encouraging schools to host their own vaccination clinics.
Parents, meanwhile, say they are facing a tough choice: send kids to school and risk infection, or keep kids home and jeopardize their mental health and educational development.
As schools forge ahead, many parents are wondering how they can safely send their children back to the classroom. My colleague Tara Parker-Pope answered some common questions.
How can it be safe for children to go back to classrooms during a pandemic?
Surprisingly, schools have not been a major cause of Covid spreading events, particularly when prevention measures are in place. A combination of protections — masking indoors, keeping students at least three feet apart in classrooms, keeping students in separate cohorts or “pods,” encouraging hand washing and regular testing, and quarantining — have been effective. The American Rescue Plan also allocated $122 billion to help school districts pay for safety measures, and the C.D.C. has allocated $10 billion for testing.
What are the risks of Covid-19 and the Delta variant to children?
Overall the news is reassuring. New research suggests the Delta variant may cause more serious illness in adults, but it’s not known if the variant puts children at greater risk. Compared with adults, children diagnosed with Covid-19 are more likely to have mild symptoms or none at all, and are far less likely to develop severe illness, be hospitalized or die from the disease. Out of about 3.5 million cases of Covid-19 in children in the U.S., 519 have died from Covid-19 (fewer than 0.015 percent).
What should parents do if their school district doesn’t have a mask policy?
The C.D.C. has said mask mandates in schools are associated with a roughly 20 percent reduction in Covid-19 incidence. But even in schools with mask mandates, compliance by children is never 100 percent. Parents in school districts without mask mandates should learn what other steps are being taken, including regular testing and ventilation measures. Parents can ask their children to wear masks in schools, but masking is far less effective if most kids aren’t doing it.
What precautions can we take at home to lower a child’s risk?
The most important step is to vaccinate everyone in the family as soon as they are eligible. This will lower the risk of a child getting infected at home and protect family members if a child brings the coronavirus home from school. In addition, everyone in the family should get flu shots this fall and make sure other vaccines are up-to-date. Paying attention to the community transmission and vaccination rates and wearing masks in risky settings can also help.

Louisiana’s “darkest days”
Louisiana has emerged as a coronavirus hot spot, with the highest per capita rate of cases in the country and a beleaguered health care system straining to keep up.
The state is averaging more than 4,300 cases a day, according to New York Times data, and hospitals are overflowing with more Covid patients than ever before. Intensive care units are packed in many hospitals, including those serving children.
“These are the darkest days of our pandemic,” said Catherine O’Neal, the chief medical officer at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge.
If there’s a bright spot among the surge, it’s that demand for coronavirus vaccines has nearly quadrupled in recent weeks in the state, providing a promising glimmer that the deadly reality of the virus might break through a logjam of misunderstanding and misinformation.
But it takes time for vaccines to bolster immune systems, and the state could still be weeks away from relief.
Vaccine rollout

- Los Angeles is considering a proposal that would require proof of vaccination in many indoor public spaces, The Los Angeles Times reports.

- A new Russian disinformation campaign appears to be spreading falsehoods about the potential for forced vaccinations in the U.S.

- The head of the most powerful U.S. teachers’ union signaled an openness to vaccine mandates.

- Virginia will require state workers to be vaccinated or get tested, the governor said.



See how the vaccine rollout is going in your county and state .
What else we’re following

- The rise of Delta and the uncertainty over schools and child care are keeping some parents from applying for jobs.

- The Australian state of Victoria went back into lockdown.

- Europe is winding down its pandemic aid programs. Is it too soon?




- CNN fired three employees who went into the office unvaccinated.

- To head off illegal dance parties, Ibiza called in foreign undercover detectives.

- Covid at the Olympic Games: 31 people tested positive, a new daily high.



What you’re doing
I am so mentally and emotionally exhausted at this stage of the pandemic that when my 5-year-old recently came down with fever, sore throat and runny nose, I took him to get tested and was almost hoping it was Covid and that the mild symptoms we were all experiencing would be our way out of this cycle of anxiety. It was negative. I did feel relieved but it continues to lurk around the corner and almost feels inevitable.

Full text: with Mariana Alfaro
Welcome toThe Daily 202 newsletter! Tell your friends to sign up here. On this day in 1990, Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait, triggering the sequence of events leading to Operation Desert Storm – a.k.a. the 1991 Gulf War.
President Biden campaigned on promises to tame the pandemic and revive the economy — and now faces a test that combines bothmissions:the end of a federal eviction banthought to have kept millions of Americans in their homes over the past year.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-imposed moratorium lapsedSunday— five weeks afterthe Biden administration said it would extend the measure"onefinal month"to July 31andfourweeksafter the Supreme Courtletthe banstand but signaled any new extensions would require Congresstoact.
But Congress didn’t act.
And while Americans may be done with the pandemic after a traumatic year and a half, the virus isn't done with Americans — the delta variant has sent case numbers soaringand driven thousands of unvaccinated people into hospitals. Political leaders are reimposing mask mandates and other precautions that many thought were a thing of the unpleasant past.
Andprogressives, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), are angry about it. Ocasio-Cortez called her fellow Democrats "cowards" and urged them to "put their names next to a 'yes' or 'no' vote, or the White House needs to do a damn thing about [eviction moratoriums]. … At the end of the day, the emergency is here. And so we need to exercise all avenues."
In fact, members of "the Squad," a group of House progressives, have been camped outside of the Capitol to protest the end of the eviction moratorium.
At the New York Times,Glenn Thrush, Matthew Goldstein and Conor Dougherty reportedthis weekend:
"The expiration was a humbling setback for President Biden, whose team has tried for months to fix a dysfunctional emergency rent relief program to help struggling renters and landlords. Running out of time and desperate to head off a possible wave of evictions, the White House abruptly shifted course on Thursday, throwing responsibility to Congress and prompting a frenzied — and ultimately unsuccessful — rescue operation by Democrats in the House on Friday."
It was not, in other words, unforeseeable or unforeseen inWashington, where Democrats control the White House, the Senate and the House — as some in the president's party pointed out in the moratorium's finalhours.
"We cannot hide. When we have a Democratic majority thatis capable of passinglegislation, we cannot hide behind the Republican Party in the lack of ability to extend the eviction moratorium," Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.)told MSNBC on Friday.
"I absolutely believe that in this moment, yes, we are failing the American people and the most vulnerable," Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) told CNN on Saturday night, urgingaction to avoid what she predicted would be an "eviction tsunami."

The exact number of Americans suddenly threatened with losing their homes isn’t completely clear, partly becausesome states have enacted their own protections and others are stepping up now.
Mycolleague Rachel Siegel wrote about the end of the moratorium hereand noted:
"It's difficult to know how many people could be served with eviction notices in the coming days and weeks, housing experts say. Moody's data shows there are still well over 6 million renters behind on payments."
TheCensus Bureau's Household Pulse surveyfor the period ending July 5 found nearly 6 million Americans behind on their mortgage payments, and another 7.4 million not caught up on rent.
Some 2.9 million have "no confidence" in being able to pay next month's mortgage payment while 4,860,000 say the same about their rent, according to that survey.
Rachel also highlighted this:
"In June, the CDC extended the ban for one final month, intensifying pressure on the Biden administration, along with state and local governments, to significantly ramp up the amount of rental assistance reaching tenants and landlords.Altogether, Congress appropriated $46 billion toward emergency rental aid. Only a fraction has been spent.
…
Public pressure to extend the moratorium compounded as coronavirus cases rose in the past few weeks. But for months earlier, vulnerable households had waited for billions of dollars in unspent emergency rental assistance.
Six months after the aid program was approved by former president Donald Trump in December, just 12 percent of the first $25 billion in funds had reached people in need due to loss of income from the pandemic, according to the Treasury Department. More than three months after President Biden signed a March relief package with another $21.5 billion for the program, even less of that has been spent, a Post investigation found."
What does that look like at the state level?
At the Tampa Bay Times,Emily L. Mahoney reported Saturday:
"The state of Florida has received more than $870 million from the federal government to make landlords whole and keep renters in their homes during thepandemic, andexpects to receive a grand total of more than $1.56 billion as more money is distributed.
It's given out around 2 percent of what it's gotten so far."
At the Texas Tribune,Allyson Waller reported:
"It's not clear exactly how many evictions in Texas will proceed once the CDC moratorium ends. Thorough statewide data on evictions is scarce, but according to the Texas Office of Court Administration, the number of cases filed — evictions sought by landlords and demands for necessary repairs by tenants — fell 28% during the year that ended Aug. 31, 2020.
But this year, from late June to early July, more than 600,000 Texas households said they were behind on their rent payments, according to a recent Census Bureau survey.The majority ofthose tenants were Black and Hispanic."
At the White House,whereofficials have said the Supreme Court's June ruling meant Biden couldn't unilaterally extend the moratorium, the president's aideshaveput the onus on states to distribute the aid more quickly and completely.
"This shouldn't be happening," deputy presssecretaryKarineJean-Pierretold reporters on Friday. "States should be making sure that these moneys are getting out as quickly as possible."

Lunchtime reads from The Post
"His campaign is over. But Trump's political groups are still spending donor money at his properties,"by Isaac Stanley-Becker and David A. Fahrenthold: "Save America, the leadership PAC where former president Donald Trump is asking loyalists to direct their political contributions, paid for lodging about two dozen times in the first six months of 2021. Nine of those times, the payments went to properties owned by the former president, according to a filing made public on Saturday. All told, the PAC sent at least $68,000 to the Trump Hotel Collection, showing how the real estate mogul — long after ending his presidential campaign and leaving office — continues to use donor money at his own properties. Make America Great Again PAC, a repurposed campaign account, spent about $200,000 on office and restaurant space in Trump Tower, according to its filing for the first half of the year. Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee for the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, separately has spent $2,200 at Trump properties so far this year, according to a filing by that committee."
"Federal monitors cost millions, with disputed results. Seattle's police watchdog was a case in point,"by David Nakamura: "Merrick Bobb came to Seattle to oversee police reform in 2012, bringing impeccable credentials, broad authority and a deep expense account. He left last summer with the police department improved but still under federal oversight, and facing renewed criticism for its use of force against Black Lives Matter demonstrators. Bobb says city officials were at times hostile to his presence, while Seattle leaders and activists say his team was tone-deaf and lacked clear performance goals. Their clashes highlight the struggles of federal monitors who have been appointed more than two dozen times across the country since 1994 to force change in troubled police agencies, but who according to their critics have not achieved lasting, measurable results. The Trump administration abandoned federal consent decrees, which it viewed as Washington overreach. But Attorney General Merrick Garland has reauthorized the Justice Department to pursue the tactic in policing and other areas, including housing and the environment."
… and beyond
"How local media spreads misinformation from vaccine skeptics,"by the New York Times's Sheera Frenkel and Tiffany Hsu: "The Freedom's Phoenix, a local news site in Phoenix, and The Atlanta Business Journal, a news site in Atlanta, both published the same article about coronavirus vaccines in March. The author was Joseph Mercola, who researchers and regulators have said is a top spreader of misleading Covid-19 information. In the article, Dr. Mercola inaccurately likened the vaccines to 'gene therapy' and argued against their usefulness. A month later, The Freedom's Phoenix and The Atlanta Business Journal also published another article by Dr. Mercola. This time, he blamed the billionaire Bill Gates for the pandemic... Dr. Mercola and other superspreaders of anti-vaccine content, who have been listed by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate as the 'Disinformation Dozen,' have appeared in articles in local publications or as guests on local radio shows and podcasts, according to a review by The Times... As the local news industry has been hit by declining advertising revenues and cuts, some outlets have sometimes unknowingly run vaccine misinformation because they have fewer employees or less oversight than in the past, said Ken Doctor, a news industry analyst."
"Jihadists flood pro-Trump social network with propaganda,"by Politico's Mark Scott and Tina Nguyen: "Just weeks after its launch, the pro-Trump social network GETTR is inundated with terrorist propaganda spread by supporters of Islamic State, according to a POLITICO review of online activity on the fledgling platform. The social network — started a month ago by members of Trump's inner circle — features reams of jihadi-related material, including graphic videos of beheadings, viral memes that promote violence against the West."
"Inside the US military's pervasive culture of eating disorders," by Task & Purpose's Haley Britzky: "Dyal is not alone among U.S. military service members who have leaned on harmful or unhealthy habits in order to maintain 'body composition standards' that trained dietitians and health experts say are antiquated and have no bearing on physical fitness. While experts agree that there should be fitness and health standards for service members, they say the existing standards don't accurately measure those things. To meet those standards, service members often adopt unhealthy behaviors like starving themselves, working out excessively, taking diet pills or laxatives, or sitting in saunas for prolonged periods of time to drop weight quickly. An Army major who struggled with bulimia for years said taking drastic measures ahead of weigh-ins is 'so common that nobody looks at it as weird.'"
On the HillThe infrastructure bill is here, and it is roughly 2,700 pages long.
"Virtually no part of the U.S. economy is untouched by the plan chiefly put together by Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.). Roughly half of its $1 trillion overall price tag constitutes new federal spending, with the rest coming from existing, planned investments in the country's roads, highways and bridges, according to details released in recent days by lawmakers and the White House, which supports the proposal," Tony Romm reports.
"The proposal, called the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, further seeks a significant tranche of funding to combat the threat of climate change, aiming to reduce emissions and respond to the deadly consequences of a fast-warming planet. Lawmakers have called for $73 billion to modernize the nation's energy grid and $21 billion to respond to environmental concerns, including pollution."
"Democrats and Republicans say they have covered the full cost of their new spending, one of the thorniest fights among the lawmakers who helped construct the deal. ...[The deal] omits both new taxes as well as user fees. Instead, it recovers its costs through a pastiche of financing mechanisms, from reclaiming past coronavirus aid funds to collecting unpaid taxes on cryptocurrencies. But there nonetheless remains concern in both parties that some of the math is fuzzy."
"With a proposal in hand, that debate began Sunday night under the fast-track timeline laid out by Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). From here, though, Senate leaders hope to finish their work by the end of the week."
"Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), one of the chief negotiators of the infrastructure deal, sounded a note of optimism about the path forward on Sunday. Appearing on CNN's 'State of the Union,' she said it remains 'my expectation and my hope' that the $1 trillion proposal could pass the Senate this week."
"Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), another negotiator, predicted that final passage could come as soon as Thursday — an ambitious timeline that may hinge on lawmakers deftly navigating what might be a difficult amendment process over the days ahead."
Read the bill here.
More than 100 legislators from other states will join Texas lawmakers in D.C. to lobby for voting bills.
"The lawmakers represent more than 20 states, including some in which Republican-led legislatures have passed or are considering new voting restrictions, and will urge senators to pass the For the People Act, or at least show progress on a federal voting law, before their summer recess. They are scheduled to rally outside the Capitol on Tuesday and press their case during other public events and private meetings," Vanessa Williams reports. "The For the People Act, which would set voting standards and overhaul campaign finance and ethics rules, has stalled in the 50-50 Senate because it can't get the support of 60 members needed to pass most legislation there. And at least two Democratic senators — Manchin and Sinema — have resisted calls to eliminate that filibuster rule, or make an exception for the bill, and allow it to pass with a simple majority."
Democrats want House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to apologize to Speaker Nancy Pelosi after he said “it will be hard not to hit” her with gavel.
"McCarthy, who was the keynote speaker for the Tennessee GOP's annual Statesmen's Dinner on Saturday, was presented at the event with an oversize gavel. He then told members of the crowd that they would be invited to his swearing-in as House speaker if Republicans won back the House majority in 2022," Amy B Wang reports. "More importantly, I want you to watch Nancy Pelosi hand me that gavel," McCarthy said to cheers.
"Democrats immediately denounced McCarthy's remarks as misogynistic, 'disgraceful' and 'no laughing matter,' especially given that Pelosi was a target of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol."
Quote of the dayThe pandemic
"A season meant to mark the great reopening of society has, instead, been darkened by the next chapter of the disease. And it has left the Biden administration at a crossroads: eager to tout a country making strides but divided internally over how to handle the threats posed by the new strand of virus and what steps Americans should take to protect themselves from it," Politico's Natasha Korecki, Erin Banco and Adam Cancryn report. "Top Biden officials note that breakthrough infections among the vaccinated are exceedingly rare, unlikely to be severe, and more likely to occur in crowded indoor settings. They've been openly frustrated by what they see as overly alarmed coverage of these cases."
"Inside the administration, the emergence of the Delta variant has caused friction, leading to behind-the-scenes finger-pointing and weeks-long tensions between the CDC and the White House. Two senior Biden officials familiar with the matter said the administration is still trying to balance messaging in a way that underscores the severity of the Delta variant while simultaneously reiterating that vaccinated individuals are overwhelmingly not at risk."
"'We thought we were going to move past this,' one senior administration official said. 'It's just like, here we go again.'"
A Tennessee Republican lawmaker who once spurned masks urged people to take coronavirus seriously after an eight-month illness.
"'It is a disease that wants to kill us,' state Rep. David Byrd (R) said in a statement Friday. Byrd, 63, described an ordeal that included 55 days on a ventilator in which covid-19 ravaged his memory, his muscles and his organs — it led to him having a liver transplant in June; his condition was so grave that his family at least once began planning for his funeral. Stressing that covid-19 is real and 'very dangerous,' Byrd encouraged people to get vaccinated," Kim Bellware reports.
“I should have gotten the damn vaccine”: A woman says her fiance texted her this before dying of coronavirus.
"Micheal Freedy was not opposed to vaccination, his fiancee said. Like many Americans who have yet to get their coronavirus shots, the 39-year-old father just wanted to wait and learn more about how people reacted to the vaccines," Hannah Knowles reports. "'All we were doing is waiting one year,' Jessica DuPreez, 37, told The Post. Then everything changed. This weekend — DuPreez's grief days old and her voice breaking — the Las Vegas mother of five gave interview after interview to spread the same message: Get the vaccine. She said Freedy came to the same conclusion early on in the fight with covid-19 that put him in an intensive care unit in July."
"'I should have gotten the damn vaccine,' he texted DuPreez, according to a picture she shared with The Post. Freedy, who is listed in her phone as 'My Heart,' died on Thursday, leaving behind young children, including a 17-month-old. … 'I would take a bad reaction to the vaccine over having to bury my husband. I would take that any day,'" DuPreez said."
Florida broke a record for coronavirus hospitalizations.
"The Sunshine State had 10,207 people hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to data reported to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. The previous record was from July 23, 2020, more than a half-year before vaccinations started becoming widespread," the AP's Mike Schneider reports. "Florida is now leading the nation in per capita hospitalizations for COVID-19, as hospitals around the state report having to put emergency room visitors in beds in hallways and others document a noticeable drop in the age of patients."
Hot on the left
Hundreds of climate experts left the government during the Trump administration. Six months into Biden's term, their jobs remain unfilled, stunting the president's climate plans."From the Agriculture Department to the Pentagon to the National Park Service, hundreds of jobs in climate and environmental science across the federal government remain vacant," the Times's Coral Davenport, Lisa Friedman and Christopher Flavelle report. "Scientists and climate policy experts who quit have not returned. Recruitment is suffering, according to federal employees, as government science jobs are no longer viewed as insulated from politics. And money from Congress to replenish the ranks could be years away. The result is that President Biden's ambitious plans to confront climate change are hampered by a brain drain."
Hot on the right
The next test of Donald Trump's influence on the Republican Party: A crowded GOP primary fight for an Ohio House seat."Tuesday's contest — in which 11 candidates are vying to replace longtime GOP congressman Rep. Steve Stivers — has caused serious consternation among the former president's advisers and even Trump himself," Josh Dawsey and David Weigel report. "Trump railed at aides after Susan Wright, the candidate he backed in a special Texas congressional race to replace her late husband, Rep. Ron Wright, lost to a state Republican lawmaker last week, they said. The defeat was an embarrassing setback for the former president. ... Trump is now making last-minute moves to bolster support for coal lobbyist Mike Carey, his pick in the Ohio special election, including hosting a get-out-the-vote tele-rally for him Monday night. A super PAC run by Trump's allies made a last-minute buy of $350,000 in text messages and other ads for Carey last week. ...
"Aides say Trump is hypercompetitive about the races he's involved in and regularly brags about his endorsement record while in the White House. His decision to tap a slate of candidates for state party positions, congressional seats and other races has been an unparalleled move for a former president. Trump has disregarded advice from advisers, who have warned that getting involved in races such as the special elections this year in Texas and Ohio and a contested Republican primary for a North Carolina Senate race could blemish his record, fueling the perception that his prominence is fading."

Olympians are probably older — and younger — than you think: There were some outliers in the old days, but even in Tokyo, athletes range from boomers through Gen Z. Bonnie Berkowitz and Artur Galocha explain through graphics.

Full text: Facebook and other social media have been under scrutiny for vaccine misinformation, but local outlets have also sometimes been active.
The Freedom's Phoenix, a local news site in Phoenix, and The Atlanta Business Journal, a news site in Atlanta, both published the same article about coronavirus vaccines in March.
The author was Joseph Mercola, who researchers and regulators have said is a top spreader of misleading Covid-19 information. In the article, Dr. Mercola inaccurately likened the vaccines to "gene therapy" and argued against their usefulness.
A month later, The Freedom's Phoenix and The Atlanta Business Journal also published another article by Dr. Mercola. This time, he blamed the billionaire Bill Gates for the pandemic, claiming Mr. Gates had "shadow control" of the World Health Organization.
Facebook and other social platforms have in recent weeks attracted attention for vaccine misinformation, as Covid cases surge from the infectious Delta variant and vaccination rates slow. But The Freedom's Phoenix and The Atlanta Business Journal are two small publications -- along with dozens of radio and television stations, and podcasts aimed at local audiences -- that have also become powerful conduits for anti-vaccine messaging, researchers said.
Dr. Mercola and other superspreaders of anti-vaccine content, who have been listed by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate as the "Disinformation Dozen," have appeared in articles in local publications or as guests on local radio shows and podcasts, according to a review by The New York Times. Some of their articles are regularly published by small-town newspapers or they are quoted as experts, The Times found.
Sherri Tenpenny, an osteopathic physician and vaccine skeptic, was recently on Coach Dave Live, a podcast in Ohio aimed at local audiences, misleadingly claiming that coronavirus vaccines disrupt people's fertility. Christiane Northrup, a physician and anti-vaccine activist, showed up on the Lillian McDermott radio show in Florida and inaccurately said the vaccines would "change human DNA." Ty Bollinger, another vaccine skeptic, was featured on News4 WSMV Nashville, an NBC-affiliated station in Tennessee, where he discussed why people should not get vaccinated.
Their appearances on local media can have an impact since Americans are more likely to believe what they read and hear from local news outlets. A 2019 Knight-Gallup study found that 45 percent of Americans trust reporting by local news organizations "a great deal" or "quite a lot," compared with 31 percent for national news organizations.
"People think they are trusting their local news, something reliable and familiar, when in fact they are trusting misinformation," said Rachel Moran, a fellow at the Center for an Informed Public at the University of Washington. "It is a huge problem and growing."
The Freedom's Phoenix, The Atlanta Business Journal, Coach Dave Live, Lillian McDermott show and News4 WSMV did not return requests for comment.
In an email, Dr. Mercola wrote, "Local communities must come together when the federal health agencies and mainstream media are under the influence of the pharmaceutical industry."
Dr. Tenpenny, Dr. Northrup and Mr. Bollinger didn't respond to requests for comment.
Many local media publications and stations have reported responsibly and factually on the pandemic. Gannett, the publisher with 100 daily newspapers and nearly 1,000 weekly publications across 43 states, has dedicated resources to fact-checking and teaching journalists that accuracy matters more than speed, said Amalie Nash, senior vice president for local news and audience development at USA Today, which is owned by Gannett.
The investment was crucial because in the pandemic, "people turned to us in record numbers to get information about lockdowns, mask policies and vaccines," Ms. Nash said.
But as the local news industry has been hit by declining advertising revenues and cuts, some outlets have sometimes unknowingly run vaccine misinformation because they have fewer employees or less oversight than in the past, said Ken Doctor, a news industry analyst. Without the resources to publish original, independent journalism, they may also rely on whatever can be freely repurposed from online material, he said.
In total, local media remains a significant force. There were 1,762 local television stations and 3,379 radio stations operating in the United States last year, according to the Radio Television Digital News Association and Syracuse University. While print publications have been decimated, there are still about 1,300 daily papers and 5,800 weekly publications, with roughly half located in small rural communities, according to research from the University of North Carolina.
Jo Lukito, an assistant journalism professor who studies disinformation at the University of Texas at Austin, said local media is often a starting point that creates a "trading up the chain" effect.
It starts when a rumor is covered or published in local media, she said, where it can gain a sheen of credibility. Then "when you pitch it to a Fox News or a larger news platform, you can say that this other outlet covered it, so it must be real," she said.
One radio show that appears to have been part of that effect is Coast to Coast AM, which is syndicated on 640 local stations and reaches nearly three million weekly listeners. Its host, George Noory, has in recent years interviewed Dr. Tenpenny, Robert Kennedy Jr., a lawyer and anti-vaccine activist, and Erin Elizabeth, the founder of the website Health Nut News and a vaccine skeptic.
The activists have used their segments on the show to reinforce their messages. In a promotion for Dr. Tenpenny's appearance to discuss the coronavirus in April 2020, for example, Coast to Coast AM's website said, "She contends that there are so many unknowns in regards to testing, tracking, symptoms, and other factors, that the information we're being told about the disease is meaningless."
That line was shared on Dr. Tenpenny's social media accounts and tweeted by some of her followers.
In a statement, Mr. Noory said, "We give all views on my program and that includes people who are opposed to vaccines."
Vaccine misinformation has also been published on sites that purport to be local news, but which are pay-for-play content websites. These sites, where articles are ordered up and paid for by conservative think tanks, political operatives, corporate executives and public-relations professionals, have sprung up to fill the vacuum left by the loss of local publications.
Recent articles on some of those sites, such as Last Frontier News in Alaska and Bowling Green Today in Kentucky, highlighted people who died after receiving the Covid vaccines without saying that it was unclear if the vaccines were responsible, according to a review by The Times. The stories followed a pattern established on anti-vaccine blogs of pulling data from a national database of post-vaccine deaths without explaining the limitations of the data.
Last Frontier News and Bowling Green Today did not respond to requests for comment.
At least one local radio host has recently recanted his anti-vaccine stance. Phil Valentine, a conservative radio host in Tennessee, had declared in a blog post in December that he would not get the vaccine because his chances of dying from the virus were "way less than one percent."
But Mr. Valentine was diagnosed with Covid-19 in July and has been hospitalized in critical condition. He has since issued a statement advising others to get vaccinated.
"Phil would like for his listeners to know that while he has never been an 'anti-vaxxer' he regrets not being more vehemently 'pro-vaccine', and looks forward to being able to more vigorously advocate that position as soon as he is back on the air, which we all hope will be soon," his station, 99.7 WTN, said on July 23.
Last Wednesday, Mr. Valentine was put on a ventilator, 99.7 WTN said. The station has added a hashtag to its posts about the host: #prayforphil.

Want to skip the vaccine in Russia? You could be suspended from work.: When Russia’s vaccine campaign stumbled, authorities dumped the responsibility on companies.

Full text: MOSCOW — When Russia's flagging vaccination campaign failed to stem a devastating third pandemic wave, authorities dumped the burden on businesses — and warned workers who refused vaccines that they could be suspended without pay.
The strategy reflects officials' desperation to boost low vaccine rates — about 16 percent — in a country with sufficient supplies of local Sputnik V and other vaccines. But it also points to wider trends globally amid struggles with the delta variant as governments explore mandates that reward the vaccinated and leave the resisters facing consequences.
Many countries are taking first steps on compulsory vaccination in some jobs. France's Parliament adopted a law Monday requiring the jab among health-care workers. In the United States, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced it would mandate coronavirus vaccines for its front-line workers, becoming the first federal agency to make the order.
Russia, however, appears to be pressing faster and harder than many nations to tie the vaccine to getting a paycheck.
In Moscow, several hundred people protested mandatory vaccines Monday at a communist-led rally. Similar demonstrations have been mounted recently in places including Greece, India and France.
Russian authorities appear squarely behind the measures that have taken shape in recent weeks: threats of harsh punishments for employers in retail and service businesses, such as transportation and restaurants, that fail to have at least 60 percent of their workers vaccinated, and of suspension for workers who refuse vaccines.
Many employers, particularly in small and medium-sized business, gripe that Russian authorities have simply passed the buck — handing responsibility for vaccination effort on businesses, when it should belong to the state in a time of growing crisis.

A surge in the coronavirus — mostly the delta variant — has brought more than 23,000 new cases and almost 800 deaths a day recently.
Although President Vladimir Putin keeps saying vaccines should not be mandatory, the effect for many Russians is just that.
"The not-very-rapid vaccination pace is among the reasons why we have so far been unable to radically contain the spread of the disease," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday.
A survey by the Moscow-based research and employment agency Superjob on July 21 found 55 percent of Russians were opposed to mandatory vaccination. A survey by the agency July 13, found that 31 percent of Russians were not willing to vaccinated under any circumstances, while 26 percent would only do so if they were forced to as a condition to keep working or get hired.
Other countries have seen strong vaccine resistance for similar reasons: swerves in official messaging and disinformation circulating on social media.
Russians' long-standing mistrust of authorities may also play a role. From the beginning of the pandemic, most Russians were distrustful of state statistics on the pandemic, according to polls in March and April by the independent Levada Center and Higher School of Economics.

In late June, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin ordered employers in key service and retail industries to ensure at least 60 percent of staff were fully vaccinated by mid-August, and dozens of other provinces followed suit. At that time, 11 percent of Russians had been vaccinated with two shots, according to official figures, even though Russian vaccines are free and have long been widely available.
Now, 16 percent have had two shots, compared with more than 49 percent in the United States and nearly 56 percent in Britain.
Retail and service companies who fail to meet the target could be shut down for months or fined. Yet some employers in the taxi and ride-share industry and food outlets have struggled still with low vaccination rates.
Many employers have called on authorities to shift back deadlines or cut the 60 percent target. Some regions have pushed deadlines back.
In other restrictions, some universities have barred unvaccinated students from dormitory accommodation. Dmitry Nesvetov, head of the Moscow branch of small- and medium-sized business association OPORA, said most employers believed the government should be responsible for meeting vaccination targets, not business.
"Of course employers do not think it's their job. Of course they think that this is the job of the government and authorities," he said.
Nesvetov said it was extremely difficult for employers to meet the 60 percent target. Those who faced the greatest difficulty were small businesses with fewer than 30 workers.
"You don't have a lot of tools to convince them or pressure them" to get vaccinated, he said. "You can try to talk to them and explain the consequences. You can use some kind of bonuses or grants to encourage them. Or you can use threats. You can suspend them or send them on vacation without pay, but you cannot fire them."
A spokesman for one Moscow ride-share company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer comments critical of the government, said the vaccine deadlines were "really tough," forcing employers to buy vaccines and set up their own vaccination points.
The spokesman said the government has resorted to "frightening businesses with fines and suspension of activities."

Another ride-share company, Citimobil, said in a statement it had bought 5,000 doses of vaccines for foreign drivers. The company offers prizes to drivers who get vaccinated, including a car raffle.
A human resources manager at one Moscow company said it missed an interim July 22 deadline for 60 percent of employees to have the first shot.
"It's the middle of the summer and many people are simply on vacation and we can't make them drop their travel plans and kids and come back to get vaccinated in this time frame," said the manager who declined to be named. "We hope that the difficulties we had will somehow be taken into account if there are some sort of checks."
She said the company had not yet suspended anyone but would do so next month, if staff refused vaccination for no good reason.
A July 13 survey by Superjob reported that 20 percent of workers knew of someone in their organization who was fired or suspended for refusing the vaccine.
Valeria Slivka, spokeswoman for popular cafe chain Shokoladnitsa, said the company managed to get 76 percent of workers vaccinated.
"Our top management inspired and motivated the staff by their example. The heads got vaccinated, filmed the process on video and shared it on our internal portal, setting a positive example to all employees of the company," she said.
A major opportunity to allay Russians' fears was missed when Putin got vaccinated in March, later issuing a brief announcement with no TV video.
According to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Moscow food chains had managed to persuade on average 25 percent of employees to get vaccinated, Kommersant newspaper reported, citing a July 12 government meeting. The Association of Retail Trade Companies which includes major supermarkets, cited problems, including staff shortages caused by leave and low supplies of vaccines in many regions.
Still, many employers decided it was better to do their best to comply with the government demands.
"Even though it's not great," said the business group head Nesvetov, "it's still better than a lockdown."

Full text: President Biden made several statements worth fact-checking at a CNN town hall in Cincinnati on Wednesday night, including on covid-19, the economy and a new child tax credit.
Here are fact checks of five of Biden's claims. As regular readers know, our usual practice is not to award Pinocchios in roundups of multiple statements.
"You're not going to get covid if you have these vaccinations."
The Biden administration has been encouraging people who haven't been vaccinated to get the shot so the country can avoid another wave of coronavirus infections.
Studies and clinical trials have shown the vaccines available in the United States to be highly effective in building immunity to the disease, with immunization rates of 90 percent or more when measuring the mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna against the initial strain of SARS-CoV-2.
However, Biden's statement in this case was not accurate, because some people with vaccine immunity in rare cases develop what are known as "breakthrough" infections. (No vaccine is 100 percent effective.)
Doctors say the symptoms are generally milder for breakthrough cases of covid-19, because the body's acquired immunity is still able to tamp down the worst of the disease.
"The good news about that, if you want to call it good news, is that the overwhelming majority of those people don't go on to get advanced disease," Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Biden's chief medical adviser on the novel coronavirus, said on MSNBC on Wednesday. "They generally are either asymptomatic or have mildly symptomatic disease. The people who are really getting into trouble, both from an infectious standpoint, namely, getting infected, and then getting a serious outcome of infection, are the unvaccinated."
Still, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has received reports of several thousand breakthrough infections. As of July 12, the CDC reported 5,189 hospitalizations involving breakthrough cases, 28 percent of which were reported as asymptomatic or not related to covid-19, and 1,063 deaths, of which 26 percent were reported as asymptomatic or unrelated to covid.
In Israel, the Pfizer vaccine prevented infections in 64 percent of people during an outbreak of the delta variant, down from 94 percent previously, according to the country's health ministry. But the Pfizer shot still prevented severe illness in 94 percent of cases, down from 97 percent previously, the Israeli Health Ministry said.
Biden at another point in his town hall described the vaccine's efficacy rate more accurately. More than 97 percent of covid-19 deaths in the United States recently are of unvaccinated individuals, health officials say. ("Ten thousand people have recently died; 9,950 of them, thereabouts, are people who hadn't been vaccinated," Biden said. "There's a simple, basic proposition: If you're vaccinated, you're not going to be hospitalized, you're not going to be in an ICU unit, and you're not going to die.")
"You may have heard that I was critical of some of the things that are on Facebook, and it was that I was 'attacking Facebook.' I wasn't attacking Facebook. There was a report out saying that, for that — something like 45 percent of the overwhelming disinformation on Facebook comes from 12 individuals. I said: 'They're killing people — those 12 individuals; that misinformation is going to kill people.' Not a joke. Not a joke."
Biden on July 16 claimed Facebook was "killing people" by letting coronavirus misinformation go unchecked on its vast social network. Days later, in his CNN town hall, the president said he never intended to single out the tech company, but rather 12 of its users who are deemed "superspreaders" of misinformation.
Biden's initial comments were much blunter.
At the White House on July 16, as Biden prepared to board Marine One, a reporter asked, "On covid misinformation, what's your message to platforms like Facebook?" Biden said: "They're killing people. I mean, they're really … look, the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated, and that — and they're killing people."
When asked to clarify those comments days later, the president said he'd recently read an article saying that the majority of misinformation on Facebook came from a dozen individuals.
"Facebook isn't killing people; these 12 people are out there giving misinformation," Biden said July 19, backtracking on his initial comments. "Anyone listening to it is getting hurt by it. It's killing people. It's bad information."
Biden appeared to be referring to a study about a group of accounts called the "disinformation dozen," identified by the Center for Countering Digital Hate as spreading vaccine misinformation or hoaxes. Facebook previously said it has taken enforcement action against pages and accounts connected to these people in more than a dozen instances.
The company published a blog post titled "Moving Past the Finger Pointing," contending that vaccine acceptance has been rising on Facebook since January and defending itself against Biden's accusation.
In December, Facebook said it would ban false and misleading statements concerning coronavirus vaccines. The company said it has removed more than 18 million pieces of coronavirus-related misinformation since the start of the pandemic, but health misinformation still persists on the platform, and Facebook hasn't disclosed the total amount of misinformation that people have seen or amplified.
"Now, by the way, remember when I first got elected, the issue was, well, I said I was going to do a million shots a week, and people said, 'Biden can't do that' or 'Biden team can't do that.' And it was 2 million."
This is a Biden mainstay that we often find ourselves fact-checking.
Vaccinations had reached a seven-day average of 980,000 by the time Biden took office — virtually the goal Biden initially set for himself. The Biden administration by spring had managed to more than double that daily total, but if you go by his comments, Biden was assured of winning the race even before he started it.
As for whether many Americans said the goal was "way over the top," we are unaware of polling that would confirm that. Most news accounts depicted Biden's goal as potentially difficult, but not unreachable, when he announced it in early December. The New York Times called the plan "ambitious," adding that "fulfilling it will require no hiccups in manufacturing or distributing the vaccine and a willingness by Americans to be vaccinated." The Washington Post also called it an "ambitious target" and USA Today pegged it as a "lofty goal."
"The cost of an automobile bill, it's kind of back to what it was before the pandemic."
Biden is wrong by several measures. The consumer price index for new and used cars in U.S. cities was 20 percent higher last month compared with February 2020, the last month before the U.S. economy went into a pandemic-induced recession for three months.
Measuring from June 2019 to June 2021, the increase in car prices is also 20 percent.
In fact, car prices seem to be driving a larger increase in the overall CPI. The indicator reached a 13-year high in May, with one-third of the increase being due to a surge in used-car prices, as CNN Business reported. (New-car prices are also up, because of factors including a shortage of computer chips.)
"It's called the child tax credit. If you have a child under the age of 7, you get 300 bucks a month — 350 bucks a month. If you have a child under — between 7 and 17, you get a total of 200 bucks a month."
These numbers are all slightly awry. Biden in March signed into law a $1.9 trillion stimulus called the American Rescue Plan, which includes a temporary expansion of the child tax credit for 2021. (We explain all the details here.)
The age limit for eligible children was raised from 16 to 17, and the value of the tax credit increased from a flat rate of $2,000 per child to $3,600 for children 5 and younger, and $3,000 for those ages 6 to 17.
For families, this means monthly payments of up to $300 for each qualifying child 5 and younger (not $350), and up to $250 (not $200) for each child ages 6 to 17. The dividing line is age 6, not 7, as Biden said.

Full text: with Mariana Alfaro
Welcome toThe Daily 202 newsletter! Tell your friends to sign up here. On this day in 1980, the Moscow Summer Olympics began — but U.S. athletes were absent because of an official boycott in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
In the latest salvo of the social media wars, acoalition of liberal individuals and groupshas written to Facebook and Twitter urging themto ban 12peoplewho,one study found,spread thebulkof disinformation about coronavirus vaccines.
"People are quite literally dying because disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic, the vaccine, and public health leaders is spreading," theywrote to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. The Daily 202 obtained an advance copy of theletter.
"Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have served as the sites for the spread of hateful speech and dangerous disinformation," the letter said."Now, as we are moving forward with reopening our country, it's critical that Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter take immediate action to protect platform users bydeplatformingtheDisinfoDozen and taking meaningful steps to stop the spread of COVID-19 disinformation."
Among the better-known signatories wereUltraViolet, the Center for Countering Digital Hate,Alianzafor Progress, GLAAD, Media Matters for America, NARAL Pro-Choice America, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and the Women's March.
The White House said last week thatthe 12 individuals cited in the letter spread 65 percent of the anti-vaccine disinformationzipping around social media platforms, evenascoronavirus cases have surgedand deaths have risen,overwhelmingamongunvaccinated Americans.
The letter came amid an escalatingand increasingly acrimoniouspressure campaign on social media titans by President Biden, who bluntlyaccusedthe tech firmsof "killing people" by doing too little to take down vaccine disinformation.
On Sunday, the White House declined to answer questions from The Daily 202 aboutwhat criteria it uses todecide whether a post amounts to disinformation versus overheated rhetoric or exaggeration relatively common to politics.
Asked about the process for reporting suspected disinformation to social media companies, a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity saidthe administration has occasionally asked social media platforms aboutspecificmisleading viral poststhatit thought mightviolate the tech firms' own policies.
At the New York Times,Cecilia Kang took stockSundayof the back-and-forth between Biden and the tech companies that run the most wide-reaching social media:
"On Sunday, the surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, reiterated warnings that false stories about the vaccines had become a dangerous health hazard.'These platforms have to recognize they've played a major role in the increase in speed and scale with which misinformation is spreading,'Mr. Murthy said Sunday on CNN.
In  a blog post  on Saturday, Facebook called on the administration to stop'finger-pointing'and laid out what it had done to encourage users to get vaccinated. The social network also detailed how it had clamped down on lies about the vaccines, which officials have said led people to refuse to be vaccinated.
'The Biden administration has chosen to blame a handful of American social media companies,'Guy Rosen, Facebook's vice president of integrity, said in the post.'The fact is that vaccine acceptance among Facebook users in the U.S. has increased.'
Mr. Rosen added that the company's data showed that 85 percent of its users in the United States had been or wanted to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. While President Biden had set a goal of getting 70 percent of Americans vaccinated by July 4, which the White House fell short of,'Facebook is not the reason this goal was missed,'Mr. Rosen said."
My colleagues Amy B. Wang and Christopher Rowland reported yesterdaythat the Bidenadministration'swarnings about disinformation"prompted Facebook to hit back at the White House and accuse Murthy of praising them privately while publicly using them as a scapegoat for Biden's missed vaccination goals.
Murthy defended the administration Sunday, saying he had also told Facebook officials they were not doing enough.
'What I have effectively said is, when we see steps that are good, that are being taken, we should acknowledge those. And there have been some positive steps taken by these technology companies,'he said on CNN.'But what I have also said to them, publicly and privately, is that it's not enough, that we're still seeing a proliferation of misinformation online.' "
It'snot clear what proportion of Americans still refusing to get the widely available, effective, andoverwhelminglysafe vaccine is doing so because of online disinformation campaigns.
Butmy colleagues Dan Diamond, Hannah Knowles, and Tyler Pager reported last weekhow parts of right-wing America have madea virtue out ofresisting the vaccine— and encouraging supporters of former president Donald Trump to do so.
"What began as'vaccine hesitancy'has morphed into outright vaccine hostility, as conservatives increasingly attack the White House's coronavirus message, mischaracterize its vaccination campaign and, more and more, vow to skip the shots altogether.
The notion that the vaccine drive is pointless or harmful — or perhaps even a government plot — is increasingly an article of faith among supporters of former president Donald Trump, on a par with assertions that the last election was stolen and the assault on the U.S. Capitol was overblown."
This is all against the backdrop of a worsening weekly rise in cases.
As the Associated Press' Jay Reeves noted this weekend:
"U.S. cases of COVID-19 last week increased by 17,000 nationwide over a 14-day period for the first time since late fall, and an increase in death historically follows a spike in illness."
What’s happening now
The U.S. and some allies accused China of hacking Microsoft and condoning other cyberattacks. "The United States, European Union, NATO and other world powers on Monday accused the Chinese government of a broad array of malicious cyber activities, blaming its Ministry of State Security and affiliated criminals for a sophisticated attack on Microsoft's widely used email server software earlier this year," John Hudson and Ellen Nakashima report. "The condemnations represent the first time NATO, a 30-nation alliance, has denounced alleged Chinese cyberattacks following the Biden administration's pledge in June to rally U.S. allies against Beijing's malign behavior. The number of nations involved amounts to the largest condemnation of China's cyber aggressions to date, U.S. officials said. The joint statements stopped short, however, of punishing China for its alleged actions …
"This is the first time Washington and other U.S. allies have assigned blame for the Microsoft Exchange hack, which compromised more than 100,000 servers worldwide. Microsoft alleged in March that its Exchange servers were compromised by a Beijing-backed hacking group that exploited several previously unknown flaws in the software. … Merely affixing blame but failing to impose a consequence will not deter future activity, said some analysts."
The Biden administration repatriated a detainee from Guantanamo Bay to Morocco, the first transfer of an inmate from the high-security prison since the Trump administration mostly halted the resettlements."The transfer of detainee Abdul Latif Nasir leaves just 39 inmates at the facility, located on a military base on the eastern tip of Cuba, and provides the first concrete illustration of how the administration may attempt to finally shutter the prison," Missy Ryan reports.
A U.S. women's gymnastics alternate tested positive for coronavirus in Tokyo,Emily Giambalvo reports. "Kara Eaker's coach, Al Fong, told a television station in Des Moines that Eaker was the gymnast who tested positive. Eaker, an 18-year-old from Grain Valley, Mo., said last month that she had been vaccinated. ... The gymnast has moved to a hotel to isolate, the USOPC said in a statement. One additional [alternate] is considered a close contact, and she is quarantining in her room until she tests negative."

Lunchtime reads from The Post
"2020 presidential polls suffered worst performance in decades, report says,"by Dan Balz: "Public opinion polls in the 2020 presidential election suffered from errors of 'unusual magnitude,' the highest in 40 years for surveys estimating the national popular vote and in at least 20 years for state-level polls, according to a study conducted by the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR). The AAPOR task force examined 2,858 polls, including 529 national presidential race polls and 1,572 state-level presidential polls. They found that the surveys overstated the margin between President Biden and former president Donald Trump by 3.9 points in the national popular vote and 4.3 percentage points in state polls."
"Haiti's acting prime minister Claude Joseph says he will step down amid leadership dispute," by Anthony Faiola: "Joseph, who has nominally led Haiti as acting prime minister since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, said in an exclusive interview with The Washington Post on Monday that he had agreed to step down, handing over power to his challenger who has been backed by the international community. The agreement ends a power struggle between two men who had been courting support internationally and domestically for their rival claims as Haiti's interim leader, and is aimed at defusing a roiling political crisis that has left the troubled Caribbean nation rudderless since the July 7 assassination."
… and beyond
"Why Disneyland's Jungle Cruise cultural changes aren't just 'woke' — they're necessary,"by Los Angeles Times's Todd Martens: "Ahead of the July 30 release of a 'Jungle Cruise' movie … the ride reopened Friday — a day shy of the park's 66th anniversary — with updates that remove, in Disney's words, 'negative depictions of native people.' In their place are slapstick-inspired scenes largely involving chimpanzees and monkeys getting the best of a prior Jungle Cruise expedition. If we can agree that Disneyland is, unlike a film or a television series, a living environment — a place born of one era but striving to be welcoming to subsequent generations — then the Jungle Cruise ride may be key to understanding theme parks as works of developing art."
"For many of the world's refugees, Mexico is their new home,"by Telemundo's Albinson Linares: "In recent years, Mexico has ceased to be a transitory country for people heading to the United States, increasingly becoming the final destination of an important migratory flow. Between 2014 and 2019, the number of asylum applications registered in the country increased from 2,137 to 70,418 — an increase of more than 3,000 percent, according to the Mexican Commission for Refugee Assistance, or COMAR."
"What is happening to our apolitical military?"by The Atlantic's Kori Schake: "Remarks by America's most senior military officer [Mark Milley] mark the latest step in the continued erosion of relations between the armed forces and their civilian leaders."
On the HillKnock on wood, this could finally be Infrastructure Week.
"After months of wind up, practice drills and tight votes, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is on the cusp of his most serious high wire act yet. The Democrat from New York returns to Washington on Monday with two goals this week: get consensus within his ranks on a $3.5 trillion budget and see once and for all whether the bipartisan group's effort to secure an infrastructure deal is real or not," CNN's Clare Foran and Lauren Fox report.
"It's notable that most members and the public still have not seen any formal language of either the bipartisan bill or the budget. Democratic rank-and-file have to make up their minds in a matter of days on two proposals they don't have the details about yet."
"Schumer is expected to file cloture Monday evening on a bipartisan piece of infrastructure legislation that doesn't even exist yet, that will set up a key test vote on the bipartisan deal on Wednesday."
"Over the weekend, the bipartisan group tried to tie up their negotiations.Sources told CNN that the group met for hours, trying to break down this proposal into smaller chunks to close it out. Ultimately though, there still isn't a resolution."
"The sticking point is what it has been for months. How do you finance $579 billion in new spending over the next five years or more than $900 billion over the next eight?"
"Senators had hoped to raise about $100 billion by empowering the Internal Revenue Service to pursue unpaid federal taxes, but Republicans balked at the idea out of a concern it would give the tax-collection agency too much power to scrutinize families' and corporations' finances," our colleague Tony Romm reports.
Remote voting in Congress, born of a crisis, has been a useful perk.
"Fourteen months after it was approved, with the public health threat in retreat and most members of Congress vaccinated, a growing number of lawmakers are using the practice to attend political events, double down on work back home or simply avoid a long commute to Washington," the New York Times's Nicholas Fandos reports.
"Perhaps no one has benefited more from the arrangement than Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who recently informed lawmakers that proxy voting would be in effect for the remainder of the summer. It has allowed Ms. Pelosi, whose majority is so slim that she can afford to lose no more than four Democrats if every member is present and voting, to all but ensure that absences alone do not cost her pivotal support."
At least five Texas House Democrats have tested positive for coronavirus in D.C.
"Three members previously tested positive for COVID-19, with the first case confirmed Friday evening and two more reported Saturday morning, including Rep. Celia Israel of Austin, who said she is experiencing mild symptoms," the Austin American-Statesman's Madlin Mekelburg and Nicole Cobler report. "The Texas House Democratic Caucus is not naming the individuals who have tested positive, but officials with the party said all of the lawmakers in Washington have been vaccinated, including those who are now infected."
"Almost all of the House Democrats who left Texas for Washington on Monday to break quorum in the House and block passage of a GOP election bill are staying in the same hotel and have been meeting regularly as a caucus and traveling frequently to the Capitol to meet with federal leaders."
The Pegasus ProjectSpyware leased by an Israeli firm to governments for tracking criminals was used in attempted and successful hacks of 37 smartphones belonging to journalists, human rights activists and business executives.
The military-grade spyware is licensed by Israeli firm NSO Group and has been used around the world to target individuals, according to an investigation by The Washington Post and 16 media partners led by the Paris-based journalism nonprofit Forbidden Stories.
"Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International, a human rights group, had access to a list of more than 50,000 numbers and shared it with the news organizations, which did further research and analysis." Here are some of the key stories from this media consortium, titled the Pegasus Project.
Khashoggi’s wife was targeted with the spyware before his death.
"The Android phone of his wife, Hanan Elatr, was targeted by a Pegasus user six months before his killing, but the analysis could not determine whether the hack was successful. The iPhone of his fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, was penetrated by spyware days after the murder, the forensics showed," Dana Priest, Souad Mekhennet and Arthur Bouvart report. "Another of Khashoggi's close associates was successfully hacked after the journalist's murder."
"NSO executives have asserted that its spyware was not used to monitor Khashoggi or his family. But a Pegasus user sent texts to Elatr, an Egyptian flight attendant Khashoggi fell in love with and eventually married, with links that could have implanted spyware; the user twice masqueraded as her sister."
"After Khashoggi's murder, someone using Pegasus targeted Cengiz's iPhone. She had accompanied him to the gates of the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul as he went to pick up documents in October 2018. Her cellphone was breached just four days after Khashoggi's murder and then five times in the days following that."
"Whether Khashoggi's cellphone was also hacked is not known. He left his phone with Cengiz when he entered the consulate. She gave it to Turkish authorities. Authorities have kept it and have declined to say whether it had been hacked."
In India, the spyware was used to hack journalists and others.
"Hundreds of Indian phone numbers appeared on a list that included some selected for surveillance by clients of NSO Group, an Israeli firm. The list contained numbers for Rahul Gandhi, India's main opposition leader; Ashok Lavasa, a key election official considered an obstacle to the ruling party; and M. Hari Menon, the local head of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation," Joanna Slater and Niha Masih report. "Others included on the list were journalists, activists, opposition politicians, senior officials, business executives, public health experts, Tibetan exiles and foreign diplomats. A group of Modi critics accused of plotting to overthrow the government also appeared on the list."
"It is not known how many of the phones on the list were actually targeted for surveillance or how many attempts were successful."
Despite the hype, your iPhone’s security is no match for NSO spyware.
"The text delivered last month to the iPhone 11 of Claude Mangin, the French wife of a political activist jailed in Morocco, made no sound. It produced no image. It offered no warning of any kind as an iMessage from somebody she didn't know delivered malware directly onto her phone — and past Apple's security systems," Craig Timberg, Reed Albergotti and Elodie Guéguen report. "Once inside, the spyware, produced by Israel's NSO Group and licensed to one of its government clients, went to work, according to a forensic examination of her device by Amnesty International's Security Lab. It found that between October and June, her phone was hacked multiple times with Pegasus/"
"The examination was unable to reveal what was collected. But the potential was vast: Pegasus can collect emails, call records, social media posts, user passwords, contact lists, pictures, videos, sound recordings and browsing histories, according to security researchers and NSO marketing materials. The spyware can activate cameras or microphones to capture fresh images and recordings. It can listen to calls and voice mails."
"And all of this can happen without a user even touching her phone or knowing she has received a mysterious message from an unfamiliar person."
"These kinds of 'zero-click' attacks, as they are called within the surveillance industry, can work on even the newest generations of iPhones, after years of effort in which Apple attempted to close the door against unauthorized surveillance."
How vulnerable are you to such spyware? Are there steps you can take to keep your phone safe? Our colleagues offer some advice here.
Quote of the dayHot on the left
Schumer's plan for cannabis reform is doomed to languish despite massive public support for legislation, writes the American Prospect's Gabrielle Gurley. "The tragedy is that the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act draft is as comprehensive a framework for federal marijuana regulation as Americans are likely to get from the legislative mortuary that is the United States Senate. ... The fight under way now on Capitol Hill is an anomaly in one respect: There are clear avenues for certain compromises. ... [Still], one factor working in legalization's favor is that Big Weed money is now pouring into politics."

Citing the Texas State House Democrats' bid to stop a new round of election laws in their state, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he'd "leave town" to stop Hill Democrats from passing the $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package."Noting that the Senate requires a quorum — the minimum number of senators present to conduct business — Graham said he 'would leave before I'd let that happen,'" USA Today reports. "Graham's departure from Washington alone would not be enough to suspend business in the evenly divided Senate.

Full text: Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy issued a warning against health misinformation Thursday, saying that falsehoods spreading quickly online have subjected large numbers of Americans to avoidable illness and death.
In remarks at the White House, Murthy called on social media companies to step up their efforts on the issue, arguing that technology firms "have enabled misinformation to poison our information environment with little accountability to their users."
"They've allowed people who intentionally spread misinformation — what we call disinformation — to have extraordinary reach," Murthy said of tech companies. "They've designed product features such as 'like' buttons that reward us for sharing emotionally charged content, not accurate content. And their algorithms tend to give us more of what we click on, pulling us deeper and deeper into a well of misinformation."
The surgeon general's advisory comes amid a rise in coronavirus cases as some Americans resist getting vaccinated against the virus despite the widespread availability of shots in the United States.
The advisory is the most high-profile action the Biden administration has taken to date to stem the tide of falsehoods spreading on social media. It is a major reversal from practice under the Trump administration, when the former president's own baseless claims about the virus often tested the social networks' covid-19 misinformation policies.
Murthy's advisory calls for the tech platforms to make investments to address disinformation, including building in more suggestions and warnings to make it harder for people to spread false information about vaccines or the virus. He also recommends that the companies make greater investments in content moderation, especially in languages other than English.
Murthy also called on the platforms to prioritize the detection of "super spreaders" and repeat policy violators.
The advisory Murthy issued Thursday has a broad list of recommendations. It advises Americans to check whether a source is trustworthy before forwarding information. It also recommends that health and educational institutions work to improve information literacy and calls on media organizations not to give a platform to newsmakers who spread misinformation.
But the surgeon general's sharpest words were directed at tech companies, which he said must operate with greater transparency and accountability. Online misinformation, Murthy said, has led some Americans to resist wearing face masks, turn down medical treatments or choose not to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, factors that have "led to avoidable illnesses and death."
"Simply put, health misinformation has cost us lives," Murthy said.
Even before the pandemic, researchers were warning Facebook, Google's YouTube and Twitter about the risk of anti-vaccine messaging shared on their services. And for years, the platforms largely took a hands-off approach.
Many of the companies stepped up their policies to fight misinformation in light of the pandemic and subsequent introduction of vaccines.
In December, Facebook said it would ban false and misleading statements concerning the coronavirus vaccine. Twitter said it would remove false claims about adverse effects of the vaccines or claims that vaccines are unnecessary. The company also started labeling tweets with misleading information about vaccines, even if they do not rise to the level of removal. YouTube says it removes coronavirus vaccine content that contradicts the World Health Organization or other health experts.
Despite these efforts, vaccine misinformation remains easy to find online. The surgeon general's report follows warnings from Democrats in Congress, who have been calling for more action from the companies since the early days of the pandemic.
Facebook spokeswoman Dani Lever said the company has partnered with government experts and health authorities to take "aggressive action" against misinformation about the coronavirus and vaccines.
"So far we've removed more than 18 million pieces of covid misinformation, removed accounts that repeatedly break these rules and connected more than 2 billion people to reliable information about covid-19 and covid vaccines across our apps," Lever said in a statement.
Twitter said in a statement that it would continue to try to elevate credible health information and enforce its policies.
"We welcome the Surgeon General's leadership and partnership in this work," Twitter spokeswoman Elizabeth Busby said in a statement.
YouTube spokeswoman Elena Hernandez said in a statement that the company "will continue working with health organizations, clinicians, and creators to increase access to high-quality health content on our platform and prevent the spread of misinformation."
In March, a coalition of 12 state attorneys general sent a letter to Facebook and Twitter, pressing them to do more to ensure that online falsehoods aren't undermining efforts to vaccinate the public against the coronavirus.
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong (D) and 11 other Democratic state attorneys general called on Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to "take immediate steps" to fully enforce their policies against vaccine misinformation.
The attorneys general said the companies have not cracked down hard enough on prominent anti-vaccine accounts that repeatedly violate the companies' terms of service.
They also said that falsehoods about the safety of coronavirus vaccines from a small pool of individuals has reached more than 59 million followers on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter, citing data from the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which studies online misinformation and disinformation.
A Facebook spokesperson said at the time that the company had worked with health organizations to update its policies and had removed 2 million pieces of content containing coronavirus and vaccine misinformation from Facebook and Instagram since February.
Twitter said in March that it had removed more than 22,400 tweets for violating its policies against coronavirus misinformation since the early days of the pandemic.
At Thursday's briefing, Murthy announced that the Rockefeller Foundation has committed to spending $13.5 million to counter health misinformation.
He also revealed the toll the pandemic has taken on his extended family.
"On a personal note, it's painful for me to know that nearly every death we are seeing now from covid-19 could have been prevented," Murthy told reporters. "I say that as someone who has lost 10 family members to covid-19 and who wishes each and every day that they had had the opportunity to get vaccinated."
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that a large amount of health misinformation is being spread by a relatively small group of individuals.
"There's about 12 people who are producing 65 percent of anti-vaccine misinformation on social media platforms," Psaki said. "All of them remain active on Facebook, despite some even being banned on other platforms, including . . . ones that Facebook owns."
Psaki's comments appeared to be a reference to the "disinformation dozen," a group of accounts identified by the Center for Countering Digital Hate as spreading vaccine misinformation or hoaxes.
Facebook has taken enforcement action against pages and accounts tied to these people in more than a dozen instances, Lever said. She said the company permanently bans accounts that repeatedly break the rules. However, she said, many of the people operate multiple accounts across multiple Facebook-owned platforms and retain active followings.

Full text: STILLWATER, Minn. — Sean G. Turnbull displays many of the hallmarks of a successful upper-middle-class family man, a former film producer and marketing manager for one of the country's largest retail corporations who lives in a well-appointed home in this Minneapolis-St. Paul suburb. Former colleagues describe him as smart, affable and family-oriented.
But for more than a decade, the 53-year-old has also pursued a less conventional path: anonymously promoting conspiracy theories about dark forces in American politics on websites and social media accounts in a business he runs out of his home. His audience numbers are respectable and his ad base is resilient, according to corporate records and interviews.
Turnbull has identified himself online for 11 years only as "Sean from SGT Reports." He has amassed a substantial following while producing videos and podcasts claiming that the 9/11 attacks were a "false flag" event, that a "Zionist banker international cabal" is plotting to destroy Western nations, that coronavirus vaccines are an "experimental, biological kill shot" and that the 2020 election was "rigged" against President Donald Trump, according to a Washington Post review.

His online venture became profitable enough that Turnbull acknowledges he left his film production job in 2015 to run it full time. He continues to do so, despite being barred from major platforms by social media companies in recent years.
An examination of Turnbull's activities — based on an interview with Turnbull and interviews with former colleagues, as well as court and corporation records — offers a view of how online conspiracy promoters have flourished in the past decade.
Turnbull's accounts have been terminated by seven tech companies, including Twitter, YouTube and Vimeo, but he has managed to keep his business going by repeatedly jumping to new outlets. He is challenging the YouTube ban — which he contends is politically motivated — in federal court.
For years, Turnbull's operation has generated revenue through subscriptions and donations and by advertising survival products and precious metals, which Turnbull has recommended as a hedge against an impending U.S. economic collapse, the Post review found. He reported that his business was generating between $50,000 and $250,000 annually in 2019, according to a voluntary business survey he answered and submitted to the Minnesota secretary of state that year.
In a 2½-hour interview with The Post, Turnbull acknowledged he was the founder of the SGT site and said he was motivated not by profit but by a drive to explore issues largely ignored by the mainstream media.
"I believe that conspiracies are real and they happen all the time," he said. When asked specifically about his views on 9/11, the coronavirus and the 2020 election, which he forcefully describes in videos respectively as "a false-flag operation," a "bioweapon" and "a coup," he offered more-measured responses, saying there were unanswered questions surrounding each of them.

He declined to go into detail about the finances of his operation but said a crackdown by social media companies on what they call misinformation has made it more difficult for him to make a living.
"I'm surviving, but I'm a fighter and I'm going to stay," said Turnbull, who has athletic features, tousled hair and horn-rimmed glasses.
He said he has striven to remain anonymous to keep the focus on his message and ideas.
"I never wanted to appear in my videos, because I wanted the message to be the star," he said.

The Post identified Turnbull by reviewing state incorporation records from 2012 for a company in Minnesota that has the same name as his website and lists him as founder.
After a Post reporter recently visited him at his home, Turnbull agreed to an extensive on-the-record interview on the condition that he could record it. Two days after the interview, he then requested that his full name not be included in this article. The Post is publishing Turnbull's name because his identity as SGT's founder already appears in public records and he voluntarily sat for an on-the-record interview without the condition of anonymity.
In a video he published on his website in late June, he said he expected this article to be "a hit piece because I was honest with [a Post reporter] about my views about this election, which I believe was rigged."
Turnbull has kept his identity private even as his website has been named in two recent court cases.
Identifying himself as the founder of SGT Report but calling himself "Michael Doe," Turnbull joined others who were banned from YouTube in filing a federal lawsuit in October in California. At the time, SGT Report's two YouTube channels had more than 630,000 and 107,000 subscribers, respectively, and their videos had been viewed a total of more than 146 million times, according to the claims in the lawsuit and an archive of the channel available through the website AltCensored.
Turnbull's website was also cited in evidence presented against an Alabama man arrested Jan. 6 after he drove to Washington ahead of the Capitol riot with an arsenal of weapons and molotov cocktails in his truck, police said. Included in court documents was a handwritten note police said they seized from Lonnie Coffman's vehicle that quoted Abraham Lincoln about overthrowing "the men who pervert the Constitution" and listing SGT Report as "good guys."
Turnbull, who in the days before the Jan. 6 event published a video titled "the countdown to the second American Revolution," told The Post that he was not aware of Coffman or the note and that he did not condone violence. "A lot of dumb people got carried away that day," he said of Jan. 6. Coffman pleaded not guilty. Coffman's attorney did not respond to messages.
Through much of the past 10 years, Turnbull's anonymity has enabled him to navigate two separate worlds, sharing details about his online business only with family and close friends, he and five former co-workers said.
A former colleague who worked with him at the small Minneapolis-based film production firm Turnbull left in 2015 knew he had a website but was surprised to learn details about its content. The person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss company personnel, said, "He seemed like a typical Minnesota family guy."
An ‘awakening’
Turnbull, who calls himself a "conspiracy researcher," once considered becoming a reporter. He earned a degree in journalism from University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire in 1992, commencement records show. During college, he said, he interned at a local news station but became disheartened by the low starting pay.
After college, he went to work for a few years at a Minnesota film production company called Hodder, before moving in 2002 to a marketing job for Target, the retail giant headquartered in Minneapolis. He rose to become a creative manager in charge of a team that produced commercials and marketing videos for the company, he and former colleagues said.
In his early years at Target, Turnbull rarely talked about politics and was part of a close-knit group of friends that socialized outside the office, two former colleagues who worked closely with him said. But sometime around 2008, Turnbull became intensely focused on questions about Sept. 11, 2001, and about the creation of the Federal Reserve, the central bank that carries out U.S. monetary policy, the colleagues said.
In his videos and podcast, Turnbull often refers to that period as his "awakening."
Turnbull left printouts of Internet stories questioning the government's findings about 9/11 on co-workers' desks and made comments that left some co-workers, including his subordinates, feeling uncomfortable, said two former colleagues who witnessed the interactions.
"He needed to convince people," one of the former colleagues said.
"People tried to tell him to stop, but he just couldn't help himself," the other former colleague said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal company personnel matters.
A spokeswoman for Target confirmed Turnbull's years of employment but did not respond to other questions about his time there.
Turnbull said his outspokenness led to his departure from Target in 2009.
"I probably started to speak a little bit too much quote-unquote truth in the workplace," he said in his interview with The Post. "And I think that probably tainted — tainted my name with the folks at Target."
"It became clear that it was time for me to go," he said.
Turnbull returned to Hodder, the film production company, and began producing television movies for major networks, he and former colleagues said. In the coming years, he co-produced television movie specials about popular shows, including one about ABC's hit TV series called "Lost: The Final Season — Beginning of the End," another called "Gossip Girl XO XO" and "Army Wives: A Final Salute," according to IMDb, an online movie database.
In 2010, while he was working as a television producer, he began creating videos for his fledgling YouTube channel in his free time, predicting a collapse of the U.S. economy and hyperinflation due to corruption by bankers and large corporations.
Turnbull told The Post that his videos at that time were "a labor of love" and "a hobby on the side." He said he worked on them late at night and when he otherwise could have been at his children's weekend soccer matches. He published video interviews with far-right commentators, conspiracy theorists, and gold and silver dealers, broadcasting from his house with only his voice and his website's logo in place of his image.
From that home office, in a 3,500-square-foot house that he said he built in 2003 and is valued at more than $700,000, according to government appraisal records, Turnbull broadcast accounts of impending apocalypse.
One video in October 2010, called "Red Alert: Total Collapse Near," featured Turnbull warning of economic disaster and positing that deceptions from powerful people in government and the banking industry flowed from a coverup of the true cause of 9/11. It received 42,000 views, according to AltCensored.
"We're talking about a doomsday scenario for our republic," Turnbull said in the video. "This is a epic, epic meltdown problem that we are seeing, and it's all going to happen in November."
"It's not too late to buy silver or gold," he said in another part of the video.
By August 2011, his website, SGT Report, was displaying banner advertisements for multiple gold and silver dealers, according to archived images of the site on the Internet Archive.
Turnbull said his "first precious-metal sponsor" was a gold and silver dealer called Miles Franklin, which paid him for a banner ad as well as a "very, very small" commission on gold and silver purchases that originated from his site. He declined to say how much revenue that and other gold and silver advertising have generated. Miles Franklin, a Minnesota-based company, did not respond to a voice-mail message seeking comment.
Turnbull also said he learned about a YouTube program that allowed him to bring in advertising revenue for commercials that aired with his videos. "I was shocked that there could be any earnings potential," he said.
On May 25, 2012, he incorporated SGTReport.com LLC in Minnesota. Turnbull said that within two years, he began to realize his operation could become a sustaining full-time job.
"I was probably making somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 grand a year pretty consistently with YouTube," just one of the venture's revenue streams, he said.
Co-workers at Hodder said Turnbull did not share much about his outside venture.
"He and I rarely ever talked about his personal political beliefs, or mine for that matter," said Tim Herbstrith, who described himself as a friend and colleague. "I found him very affable. He did not live his life like the person that you would imagine if you saw the website."
David Fried, the former operations director at Hodder, said: "Sean was professional and good at what he did. I knew that he had this interest in things a little more conspiratorial, but he never proselytized, so in that respect there wasn't a lot of crossover, or any at all, with work."
Kent Hodder, the owner of the company, declined to comment through an email.
Dual worlds
In 2014, the same year Turnbull produced a Disney TV special called the "ABC's of Schoolhouse Rock," he was making videos for his YouTube channel that referred to the Rockefeller and Rothschild families — early titans of industry and banking — as a "cartel" and calling the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting a "hoax."
In a video interview on his YouTube channel dated Aug. 30, 2014, he spoke about his dual worlds.
"So many of us feel isolated in this truther community," he said. "We feel isolated from family, from friends, from colleagues because most of the people in our daily lives are not able to articulate these issues, and therefore many of us are not able to talk about these issues very darn often with very many darn people."
While his wife called him a "truth teller" in an exchange on their porch as Turnbull weighed a Post interview, Turnbull has said other family members have not listened to his warnings. "You know, my mom, I don't think she's ever watched a video I did on YouTube," he said in the interview.
His mother, mother-in-law and neighbors, he has said in his videos, have not heeded his warnings about coronavirus vaccinations, which he has called "death stabs" under headlines such as: "Vaxxed people will die in two years. The republic even sooner."
Turnbull left Hodder in 2015. In the interview with The Post, Turnbull said he told his employer: "Look, I'm making a bit of money here on YouTube. I think I can survive."
His departure coincided with the onset of the Trump era, a time when elaborate conspiracy theories and anti-government rhetoric began emanating from the White House. The extremist movement QAnon — a collection of groundless allegations built around the notion that Democratic politicians, abetted by celebrities, are Satan-worshiping pedophiles who traffic children for sexual purposes — also began to take flight.
At the same time, Turnbull began to diversify his business's revenue streams.
In May 2017, Turnbull launched a fundraising account on Patreon, a site that allows fans to pay fees to become "patrons" of their favorite content creators. On his Patreon page, he referred to the account as "an emergency backup plan" due to an effort by Google that year to change its search algorithm to not feature misinformation as prominently in its results.
"We just want to keep doing what we're doing regardless of Google's strategy to strangle us," Turnbull wrote on his Patreon page under the name SGT.
By November 2019, more than 1,300 people were paying $5 a month to qualify as SGT patrons, according to an archived version of the now-shuttered Patreon page. That is equivalent to $6,500 per month, before Patreon's fees, which range between 5 and 12 percent.
Turnbull said his website traffic and revenue were peaking in 2018 and 2019 but declined to provide details. He often posted videos promoting QAnon ideology but insisted in the interview with The Post that he was hopeful, but not certain, the theory was true.
A gold and silver dealer called SD Bullion that advertises on his site also offered an ounce of silver coin emblazoned with the website's name along with the QAnon motto: "WHERE WE GO ONE WE GO ALL."
"SGT Report is a daily source for truth in a time of 'universal deceit,'" SD Bullion's webpage says on an undated promotional page for the coin, which indicates it is sold out.
Turnbull did not respond to an emailed question about the coin.
Tyler Wall, the CEO of SD Bullion, whom Turnbull regularly interviewed on SGT Report, did not respond to multiple messages left at his office seeking an interview. Turnbull said that the company, which he called "a supporter" of his website, pays a monthly fee to advertise on SGT Report and that it does not pay him commissions.
His YouTube videos regularly garnered more than 100,000 views and some received more than 1 million during Trump's presidency, according to archived copies on AltCensored.
Last fall, with the presidential election nearing, tech giants came under increased pressure to address the use of their platforms to spread false information. Turnbull's accounts were soon caught up in a broader crackdown.
On Oct. 15, YouTube took down SGT's two channels, part of its purge of websites it said promoted spurious accusations and had the potential to incite real-world violence. A week later, Patreon shut down his page.
"We removed the creator sgtreport.com from Patreon as he violated our guidelines on disinformation by propagating the QAnon conspiracy theory," Patreon said in a statement.
Twitter and Vimeo also terminated SGT Report's accounts for violating their guidelines, according to spokespeople for both companies.
Turnbull and 14 other content creators — seven using pseudonyms to shield their identity — filed a federal lawsuit against YouTube and its parent company, Google, in the Northern District of California the same month of their removal, alleging the company did not abide by its contractual agreements with content creators.
YouTube responded in court documents that the channels "were rife with content espousing harmful conspiracy theories" and "included horrifying and unsubstantiated accusations of violent and criminal conduct supposedly committed by specific individuals." YouTube did not challenge the plaintiffs' request for anonymity and a judge allowed it, court records show.
Turnbull, identifying himself as "Michael Doe," wrote in a court filing that he assumed his channels were terminated because "they have a widespread audience reach, I am not a member of the mainstream media, and my content has at times focused on or questioned mainstream media or government."
Turnbull acknowledged in the interview with The Post that he is Michael Doe.
"I am proceeding under a pseudonym in this case because I have maintained my anonymity with respect to the work that I do and the speech that I offer to the public," he wrote in a court filing, offering few details about his background except that he had earned a degree in broadcast journalism from the University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire in 1992.
His attorney offered an additional reason he and others wanted to remain anonymous.
"If the speech of the Plaintiffs is actually threatening or connected to 'real-world violence' as YouTube seems to suggest in its blog post, then the Plaintiffs could be subject to criminal liability," the attorney for the plaintiffs wrote in court files.
The lawsuit is in its preliminary stages.
In the meantime, Turnbull has shifted yet again to new platforms.
He has a fundraising page on the website SubscribeStar, which allows his followers to choose between $3 and $40 monthly subscriptions that offer services ranging from access to his videos and interviews to personal handwritten letters or calls thanking subscribers. He is also providing a streaming channel through an Internet platform called Secure Server TV that allows his videos to be streamed for a $3.99 monthly subscription.
Turnbull did not respond to an emailed question about the number of subscribers on the sites.
During the interview, he said he has no plans to halt his venture.

Full text: In December, I argued that the coronavirus vaccination campaign would be a test of who had the upper hand in the United States: the geniuses (not all of them American) who invented and produced these safe and effective vaccines in record time or the conspiratorial crackpots who believe Internet rumors that vaccines are unsafe and unnecessary. More than six months later, it's evident that the forces of ignorance and irrationality are so strongly entrenched that no amount of scientific evidence and public exhortation will sway them.
The United States missed President Biden's target for administering a vaccination shot to 70 percent of adults by July 4. Only 67 percent of adults have received at least one dose. That may not seem so bad, but the United States, after getting off to a fast start in its vaccination campaign, is once again falling behind its peers. According to the New York Times, the percentage of all Americans (not just adults) who have gotten at least one vaccine shot is only 55 percent — which places us at No. 28 in the world, behind countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and even Hungary.
The Biden administration, in cooperation with the states, has done a superb job of rolling out the vaccines. Pretty much anyone older than 12 who wants a shot can get one. The problem is that a significant percentage of the country refuses to get vaccinated. While young people and African Americans exhibit vaccine hesitancy, the most problematic group by far is Republicans. According to a new Post-ABC News poll, 86 percent of Democrats have gotten at least one vaccine shot, compared with only 45 percent of Republicans. Forty-seven percent of Republicans say they likely won't get vaccinated, compared with only 6 percent of Democrats.
The states that have the lowest vaccination rates — Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Wyoming — are all Republican redoubts. It's no coincidence that many red states are also seeing the worst outbreaks of the disease in recent weeks: The average number of daily cases in the past 14 days has surged 145 percent in South Carolina, 137 percent in Nebraska and 121 percent in Arkansas. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calculates that 99.5 percent of U.S. covid-19 deaths in the past six months were among unvaccinated people.
What's wrong with the people who aren't getting vaccinated? Aren't they worried about the far more transmissible delta variant? Data from Israel show that, while the Pfizer vaccine is only 64 percent effective in preventing delta-variant infection, it is 93 percent effective in preventing hospitalization. That's still a powerful argument for vaccination. But 57 percent of Republicans in the Post-ABC poll say officials are exaggerating the delta variant's risk, compared with only 12 percent of Democrats. These Republicans have fallen victim to a virulent strain of misinformation circulating in the right-wing echo chamber.
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), of "Jewish space lasers" fame, tweeted on June 22, based on outdated guidance, that "The WHO says 'children should not be vaccinated.'" (The World Health Organization actually says "that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is suitable for use by people aged 12 years and above.")
On July 3, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) tweeted: "I've been contacted by members of our voluntary military who say they will quit if the COVID vaccine is mandated. I introduced HR 3860 to prohibit any mandatory requirement that a member of the Armed Forces receive a vaccination against covid-19." Numerous veterans pointed out that military members can't simply "quit" — that would be going AWOL — and that they already receive numerous mandatory vaccinations.
These despicable demagogues don't come out and simply say vaccines are dangerous. Rather, like many conspiracy mongers, they imply it by asking loaded questions. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), for example, recently sent letters to the CEOs of Pfizer and Moderna "seeking answers about adverse reactions to the covid-19 vaccine." His demand for "answers" was then reported by Fox "News," which has become a superspreader of vaccine disinformation.
When Fox's top-rated bloviator Tucker Carlson is not busy fearmongering about immigration, he is fearmongering about vaccination. He has repeatedly claimed, for example, that the administration's own data "show a massive increase in deaths" from coronavirus vaccines. Not quite. He is citing uncorroborated reports that can be submitted by anyone. These raw numbers include people who died in a car accident or committed suicide after being vaccinated. Naturally, Carlson won't say if he has been vaccinated himself. He is fearmongering for both profit and political advantage.
Sadly, roughly one-third of the country is impervious to science and even self-interest. That's a big problem for the rational rest. Widespread vaccine resistance ensures that covid-19 will continue circulating as more virulent strains emerge. The only way we are likely to achieve "herd immunity" now is the hard way — by having a lot more people fall ill and die from the delta variant. The anti-vaxxers have a lot to answer for.

Full text: Just days after violent conflict erupted in Israel and the Palestinian territories, both Facebook and Twitter copped to major faux pas: The companies had wrongly blocked or restricted millions of mostly pro-Palestinian posts and accounts related to the crisis.
Activists around the world charged the companies with failing a critical test: whether their services would enable the world to watch an important global event unfold unfettered through the eyes of those affected.
The companies blamed the errors on glitches in artificial intelligence software.
In Twitter's case, the company said its service mistakenly identified the rapid-firing tweeting during the confrontations as spam, resulting in hundreds of accounts being temporarily locked and the tweets not showing up when searched for. Facebook-owned Instagram gave several explanations for its problems, including a software bug that temporarily blocked video-sharing and saying its hate speech detection software misidentified a key hashtag as associated with a terrorist group.
The companies said the problems were quickly resolved and the accounts restored. But some activists say many posts are still being censored. Experts in free speech and technology said that's because the issues are connected to a broader problem: overzealous software algorithms that are designed to protect but end up wrongly penalizing marginalized groups that rely on social media to build support. Black Americans, for example, have complained for years that posts discussing race are incorrectly flagged as problematic by AI software on a routine basis, with little recourse for those affected.
Despite years of investment, many of the automated systems built by social media companies to stop spam, disinformation and terrorism are still not sophisticated enough to detect the difference between desirable forms of expression and harmful ones. They often overcorrect, as in the most recent errors during the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, or they under-enforce, allowing harmful misinformation and violent and hateful language to proliferate, including hoaxes about coronavirus vaccines and violent posts ahead of the U.S. Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6.
The Palestinian situation erupted into a full-blown public relations and internal crisis for Facebook. Last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg dispatched the company's top policy executive, Nick Clegg, to meet with Israeli and Palestinian leadership, according to the company. Meanwhile, Palestinians launched a campaign to knock down Facebook's ranking in app stores by leaving one-star reviews. The incident was designated "severity 1" — the company's term for a sitewide emergency, according to internal documents reviewed by The Washington Post and first reported by NBC. The documents noted that Facebook executives reached out to Apple, Google, and Microsoft to request that the posts be deleted.
Meanwhile, a group of 30 Facebook employees, some of whom said they had friends and family affected by the conflict, have complained of "over-enforcement" on the Palestinian content in an open letter on the company's workforce messaging boards, according to another set of internal documents reviewed by The Post. The group has filed at least 80 tickets to report "false positives" with the company's automation systems in relation to the conflict, noting many of the problems were with the AI mistakenly labeling images of protests as "harassment or bullying."
Jillian York, a director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocacy group that opposes government surveillance, has researched tech company practices in the Middle East. She said she doesn't believe that content moderation — human or algorithmic — can work at scale.
"Ultimately, what we're seeing here is existing offline repression and inequality being replicated online, and Palestinians are left out of the policy conversation," York said.
Facebook spokeswoman Dani Lever said the company's "policies are designed to give everyone a voice while keeping them safe on our apps, and we apply these policies equally." She added that Facebook has a dedicated team of Arabic and Hebrew speakers closely monitoring the situation on the ground, but declined to say whether any were Palestinian. In an Instagram post May 7, Facebook also gave an account of what it said led to the glitch.
Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough said the enforcement actions were "more severe than intended under our policies" and that the company had reinstated the accounts where appropriate. "Defending and respecting the voices of the people who use our service is one of our core values at Twitter," she said.
Palestinian activists took to the social media platforms as they began staging protests in late April ahead of an impending Israeli Supreme Court case over whether settlers had the right to evict families from their homes in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah. Potential evictees live-streamed confrontations and documented footage of injuries after Israeli police stormed al-Aqsa Mosque, one of the holiest sites in Islam.
The conflict descended into war after terrorist group Hamas, which governs Gaza, fired explosive rockets into Israel. Israel responded with an 11-day bombing campaign that killed 254 Palestinians, including 66 children. Twelve people in Israel were killed, including two children.
During the barrage, Palestinians posted photos on Twitter showing homes covered in rubble and children's coffins. A cease-fire took effect May 20.
Palestinian activists and experts who study social movements say it was another watershed historical moment in which social media helped alter the course of events. They compared it to a decade ago, when social media platforms were key to organizing the pro-Democracy uprising known as the Arab Spring. But at the time, tech companies didn't rely on policing algorithms, rather humans making decisions. And while mistakes were made, nothing occurred on the scale of today, York said.
Even after the companies said the glitches were fixed, 170 Instagram posts and five Twitter posts that activists believe were wrongly removed were still offline, according to 7amleh, the Arab Center for the Advancement of Social Media, a group that advocates for Palestinian digital rights. The group said in a report in late May that it was told by the companies that some of the remaining posts are under review.
Facebook declined to comment. Twitter's Rosborough said she could not comment without seeing the tweets.
During the early protests in East Jerusalem, some posts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram were taken down for using the hashtag #SaveSheikhJarrah, the name of the neighborhood in dispute, said Iyad Alrefaie, director of Sada Social, a group that tracks digital rights in the Palestinian territories.
Mariam Barghouti, a Palestinian-American journalist who covers the West Bank for Al Jazeera and other outlets, posted on Instagram that she had her account restricted by Twitter for purportedly violating the company's social media policy while covering a protest. She said in media interviews that she did not know which tweets broke the rules. The company later restored her account and tweets, saying it made an error, according to spokeswoman Rosborough.
Digital rights groups Access Now, 7amleh and other organizations have spent the years since the Arab Spring documenting problems with how social media companies handle Palestinian content, as well as content from the region at large.
In 2016, Facebook blocked the accounts of several editors at two Palestinian news organizations without giving a reason, Al Jazeera reported at the time. After complaints, the social media company reversed the bans and said they had been accidental. In 2019, Twitter suspended accounts run by a Palestinian news organization, Quds News Network, in a sweep of terrorist accounts (which have since been reinstated, Twitter said). In May 2020, Facebook deactivated the accounts of more than 50 Palestinian journalists and activists without providing an explanation, activists said, including from journalists who posted footage of attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinian farmers in occupied territories.
Facebook declined to comment on those examples.
Facebook took down a post from a father wishing his infant son, named Qassam, a happy birthday, according to Alrefaie, the director of Sada Social. The group assumed that it was because the company blocks many posts about al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's military wing.
"These words are part of our discourse, it's a part of our culture," Alrefaie said. "Facebook didn't differentiate between any context." Facebook declined to comment on that incident.
Marwa Fatafta, digital rights policy manager for the Middle East and North Africa region for Access Now, said other keywords, such as the term Zionist, are often banned when Palestinians use them because it's assumed to be antisemitic.
"Under our current policies, we allow the term 'Zionist' in political discourse, but remove attacks against Zionists in specific circumstances, when there's context to show it's being used as a proxy for Jews or Israelis, which are protected characteristics under our hate speech policy," Facebook's Lever said.
Some activists have developed workarounds to the algorithms, including using an ancient method of writing Arabic, according to an article by independent Egyptian news website Mada Masr. Some U.S. activists use similar tactics, purposely misspelling common words like "white" to avoid algorithmic censorship during discussions of race, The Post has reported.
Activists have also decried tech companies' relationship with the Israeli government, and in particular the Ministry of Justice's Cyber Unit — which has a direct channel to technology companies to report potential content violations. They have asked tech companies to be transparent about when the government secretly refers accounts to be blocked or content to be removed, including whether the unit was involved in takedowns during the war.
Facebook, Google and Twitter all said they comply with local laws and regularly respond to takedown requests from governments, which they publish in biannual transparency reports. Twitter said the spam filter issue had nothing to do with Israeli authorities. Facebook did not respond to several requests for comment about the nature of reports by Israeli authorities during the recent crisis. A Google spokesman declined to say whether it received bulk requests from the Cyber Unit.
Journalists and activists have also complained that Google hasn't updated its maps of Gaza with higher-resolution images, despite a U.S. law limiting the degree of detail in public maps of the area being lifted in 2020. Detailed maps help document the damage from airstrikes.
Google declined to comment on why the Gaza maps have not been updated.
Payment app Venmo also mistakenly suspended transactions of humanitarian aid to Palestinians during the war. The company said it was trying to comply with U.S. sanctions and had resolved the issues.
Tech companies are caught between governments trying to stop unrest or violence and activists advocating for free democratic expression, said James Grimmelmann, a law professor at Cornell Tech.
"So the platforms really have to make deeply political choices," he said.
The latest issues began May 5, when Instagram started receiving reports that people participating in protests in Colombia could not share video, the company later said in a post in which it apologized for its errors. The next day, similar reports came from people participating in demonstrations in Canada and in East Jerusalem. Executives discovered a glitch in a long-planned update to video-sharing products, called Stories. In its apology, the company noted that the bug had nothing to do with these particular events, and in fact had affected more users in the United States than elsewhere.
Several days later, citizens and activists began reporting their posts about al-Aqsa Mosque, using the hashtag #AlAqsa or its Arabic counterparts, were being restricted. The restrictions were often accompanied by a pop-up that said the term was associated with "violence or dangerous organizations."
On May 11, a Facebook employee filed a grievance, according to a report by BuzzFeed. Facebook said in response that the name of the mosque was a designated terrorist organization. Facebook later told The Post that the hashtag had been restricted in several ways, including limiting people's ability to search for it.
After publication, Facebook's Lever added that human error led to the issue of restricting the al-Aqsa Mosque hashtag.
Palestinian activists and Facebook employees began to protest in the coming days that many posts about the conflict were being taken down automatically.
Around the same time, Twitter began fielding reports that influential accounts tweeting about the conflict were being unexpectedly suspended, the company said, due to AI mistaking posts for spam. The company says it restored the accounts a few hours later.
Twitter spokeswoman Rosborough noted that similar incidents of overly severe enforcement took place during the 2020 presidential debates and during protests against a coup this spring in Myanmar.
And sometimes, she pointed out, algorithms get things right: At one point during the conflict, an algorithm also automatically restricted the Israeli army's official account. The account was trying to post the same tweet twice, of emergency sirens going off in the southern city of Beersheba, and Twitter blocked it.
"We know it's repetitive — but that's the reality for Israelis all over the country," the tweet said.

Full text: LONDON - Several European influencers say they have been offered money to use their social media presence to discourage their millions of followers from receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine by a suspicious agency that French officials reportedly think could be linked to Russia.
According to the influencers, they were approached online by a self-proclaimed public relations agency and asked to tell their large followings that the Pfizer vaccine is dangerous and has caused more deaths than the one developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. The AstraZeneca vaccine has been plausibly linked to extremely rare but in some cases fatal blood clots. European and U.S. regulators have not linked the Pfizer vaccine to any such side effects.
Taking to Twitter earlier this week, French YouTuber Léo Grasset - also known as DirtyBiology - said he had received a "strange" proposal and attached screenshots of the request, which asked him to falsely tell followers that "the mainstream media ignores" the fact that the vaccine has been connected to a high death toll. The messages informed Grasset that the agency had a "colossal budget" and that if he wanted to work with the company, he would have to hide sponsorship details from viewers.
"I received a partnership proposal, which consists of damaging the Pfizer vaccine on video," he said, as he warned social media users that influential personalities were being targeted by conspirators who wanted to create vaccine skepticism.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - produced by a German and an American company - has by far been the most frequently administered coronavirus vaccine in France.
The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the disinformation effort had triggered an investigation by French counterintelligence authorities to examine whether the Russian government orchestrated it.
The French Defense and Health ministries did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.
French Health Minister Olivier Véran said in an interview on Tuesday: "I do not know where it comes from, I do not know if it comes from France or from abroad."
The agency behind the offer goes by the name of Fazze and originally claimed to be based in London - although no record shows it as registered there. On its website, the agency describes itself as an "influencer marketing platform" but does not offer contact details. Its Instagram account is private, a change that was recently made, according to the Guardian.
Grasset later told his Twitter followers that those who had claimed to be employed at the company all had links to Russia, writing that the professional profiles of those in question had since vanished from LinkedIn.
Véran, France's health minister, slammed the effort on Tuesday, calling it "dangerous" and "irresponsible." Some influencers had been offered up to $2,450 to publish the posts, according to French media outlets.
The incident has raised concerns about more targeted disinformation campaigns, as vaccinations are finally gaining momentum in Europe and the focus of authorities may soon shift from meeting demand for vaccine shots to persuading holdouts.
France was among the world's most vaccine-skeptical nations when coronavirus vaccines were rolled out late last year. At the time, about 60 percent of the French were not inclined to get the shots, an Ipsos survey showed.
Hoping to counter skepticism, France's government has implemented its vaccination campaign more carefully than other countries have, insisting on time-consuming pre-vaccination consultations and a cautious interpretation of vaccine manufacturers' guidelines.
The return to a degree of normalcy in countries that quickly vaccinated their populations, including Israel, has shifted the public debate in France in recent months. France has now partly vaccinated more than 34 percent of its population, which puts it ahead of some other European countries that had lower rates of vaccine skepticism earlier this year.
But France may remain more vulnerable to targeted disinformation campaigns than some of its neighboring countries. Officials are concerned that the country's vaccination campaign may slow down sooner than elsewhere, as the number of new cases continues to go down and the urgency of the pandemic is somewhat fading from the public debate.
Speaking to The Washington Post earlier this year, members of France's pro-vaccine group Les Vaxxeuses said the government has been too slow to counter online disinformation campaigns. Anti-vaccine videos have been viewed millions of times on French social media over the past year.
Meanwhile, the absence of an early and effective online government information campaign to dispel doubts meant that "the space was empty, there was no scientific discussion," a member of the group said earlier this year, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Other influencers - including German journalist Mirko Drotschmann, who has almost 1.5 million subscribers on YouTube, and artist Sami Ouladitto - said they were targeted with requests to discredit the Pfizer vaccine.
Earlier this month, Drotschmann tweeted that he had been asked to join an online "information campaign," with organizers inviting him to share supposedly leaked documents about deaths after Pfizer vaccinations. He told his followers that the chief executive of the company appeared to be based in Moscow, but he did not name the company or people who had contacted him.
Although it is being used in multiple countries, Russia's Sputnik V vaccine has yet to receive approval from the European Union's medicines agency, which officials say is the result of a lack of adequate information. Last month, the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency rejected the vaccine, listing significant safety concerns that include a lack of quality control and an absence of details regarding the vaccine's side effects.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia was willing to give Brazil additional data if required.

Full text: LONDON — Several European influencers say they have been offered money to use their social media presence to discourage their millions of followers from receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine by a suspicious agency that French officials reportedly think could be linked to Russia.
According to the influencers, they were approached online and asked to tell their large followings that the Pfizer vaccine is dangerous and has sparked more deaths than the one developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been plausibly linked to extremely rare but in some cases fatal blood clots. European and U.S. regulators have not linked the Pfizer vaccine to any such side effects.
Taking to Twitter earlier this week, French YouTuber Léo Grasset — also known as DirtyBiology — said he had received a "strange" proposal and attached screenshots of the request, which asked him to falsely tell followers that "the mainstream media ignores" the fact that the vaccine has been linked to a high death toll. The messages informed Grasset that the agency had a "colossal budget" and that if he wanted to work with the company, he would have to hide sponsorship details from viewers.
"I received a partnership proposal, which consists of damaging the Pfizer vaccine on video," he said, as he warned social media users that influential personalities were being targeted by conspirators who wanted to create vaccine skepticism.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine ― produced by a German and an American company ― has by far been the most frequently administered coronavirus vaccine in France.
The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the disinformation effort had triggered an investigation by French counterintelligence authorities, to examine whether the Russian government orchestrated it.
The French Defense and Health ministries did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.
French Health Minister Olivier Véran said in an interview on Tuesday: "I do not know where it comes from, I do not know if it comes from France or from abroad."
The self proclaimed public relations agency behind the offer goes by the name of Fazze and originally claimed to be based in London — although no record shows it as registered there. On its website, the agency describes itself as an "influencer marketing platform" but does not offer contact details. Its Instagram account is private, a change that was recently made, according to the Guardian.
Grasset later told his Twitter followers that those who had claimed to be employed at the company all had links to Russia, writing that the professional profiles of those in question had since vanished from LinkedIn.
Véran, France's health minister, slammed the effort on Tuesday, calling it "dangerous" and "irresponsible." Some influencers had been offered up to $2,450 to publish the posts, according to French media outlets.
The incident has raised concerns about more targeted disinformation campaigns, as vaccinations are finally gaining momentum in Europe and the focus of authorities may soon shift from meeting demand for vaccine shots to persuading holdouts.
France was among the world's most vaccine-skeptical nations when coronavirus vaccines were rolled out late last year. At the time, about 60 percent of the French were not inclined to get the shots, an Ipsos survey showed.
Hoping to counter skepticism, France's government has implemented its vaccination campaign more carefully than other countries have, insisting on time-consuming pre-vaccination consultations and a cautious interpretation of vaccine manufacturers' guidelines.
The return to a degree of normalcy in countries that quickly vaccinated their populations, including Israel, has shifted the public debate in France in recent months. France has now partly vaccinated more than 34 percent of its population, which puts it ahead of some other European countries that had lower rates of vaccine skepticism earlier this year.
But France may remain more vulnerable to targeted disinformation campaigns than some of its neighboring countries. Officials are concerned that the country's vaccination campaign may slow down earlier than elsewhere, as the number of new cases continues to go down and the urgency of the pandemic is somewhat fading from the public debate.
Speaking to The Washington Post earlier this year, members of France's pro-vaccine group Les ­Vaxxeuses said the government has been too slow at actively countering online disinformation campaigns. Anti-vaccine videos have been viewed millions of times on French social media over the past year.
Meanwhile, the absence of an early and effective online government information campaign to dispel doubts meant that "the space was empty, there was no scientific discussion," a member of the group said earlier this year, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Other influencers — including German journalist Mirko Drotschmann, who has almost 1.5 million subscribers on YouTube, and artist Sami Ouladitto — said they were targeted with requests to discredit the Pfizer vaccine.
Earlier this month, Drotschmann tweeted he had been asked to join an online "information campaign," with organizers inviting him to share supposedly leaked documents about deaths after Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinations. He told his followers the chief executive of the company appeared to be based in Moscow, but he did not name the company or people who had contacted him.
Although it is being used in multiple countries, Russia's Sputnik V vaccine has yet to receive approval from the European Union's medicines agency, which officials say is the result of a lack of adequate information. Last month, Brazil's Health Regulatory Agency rejected the vaccine, listing significant safety concerns that include a lack of quality control and an absence of details regarding the vaccine's side effects.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia was willing to give Brazil additional data if required.
Noack reported from Paris.

Full text: QAnon adherents and other far-right influencers are making thousands of dollars broadcasting election and vaccine conspiracy theories on the streaming site.
Terpsichore Maras-Lindeman, a podcaster who fought to overturn the 2020 presidential election, recently railed against mask mandates to her 4,000 fans in a live broadcast and encouraged them to enter stores maskless. On another day, she grew emotional while thanking them for sending her $84,000.
Millie Weaver, a former correspondent for the conspiracy theory website Infowars, speculated on her channel that coronavirus vaccines could be used to surveil people. Later, she plugged her merchandise store, where she sells $30 “Drain the Swamp” T-shirts and hats promoting conspiracies.
And a podcaster who goes by Zak Paine or Redpill78, who pushes the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, urged his viewers to donate to the congressional campaign of an Ohio man who has said he attended the “Stop the Steal” rally in Washington on Jan. 6.
All three spread their messages on Twitch, a livestreaming video site owned by Amazon that has become a new mainstream base of operations for many far-right influencers. Streamers like them turned to the site after Facebook, YouTube and other social media platforms clamped down on misinformation and hate speech ahead of the 2020 election.
Twitch comes with a bonus: The service makes it easy for streamers to make money, providing a financial lifeline just as their access to the largest online platforms has narrowed. The site is one of the avenues, along with apps like Google Podcasts, where far-right influencers have scattered as their options for spreading falsehoods have dwindled.
Twitch became a multibillion-dollar business thanks to video gamers broadcasting their play of games like Fortnite and Call of Duty. Fans, many of whom are young men, pay the gamers by subscribing to their channels or donating money. Streamers earn even more by sending their fans to outside sites to either buy merchandise or donate money.
Now Twitch has also become a place where right-wing personalities spread election and vaccine conspiracy theories, often without playing any video games. It is part of a shift at the platform, where streamers have branched out from games into fitness, cooking, fishing and other lifestyle topics in recent years.
But unlike fringe livestreaming sites like Dlive and Trovo, which have also offered far-right personalities moneymaking opportunities, Twitch attracts far larger audiences. On average, 30 million people visit the site each day, the platform said.
Twitch “monetizes the propaganda, which is unique,” said Megan Squire, a computer science professor at Elon University who tracks extremists online. She said it was as though listeners of the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who died in February, were donating in real time and chipping in greater sums whenever Mr. Limbaugh shared more controversial ideas.
“You can turn the dial up and down and turn the flow of money up and down by saying certain things on your stream,” Ms. Squire said.
At least 20 channels associated with far-right movements have started broadcasting on Twitch since the fall, according to data compiled by Genevieve Oh, a livestreaming analyst. Dozens more have been on the site for longer. Some are associated with QAnon, the false theory that former President Donald J. Trump is fighting a cabal of Democratic pedophiles.
The channels range from intermittent broadcasters with several hundred views to ones that go live nearly every day and attract thousands of viewers.
In a statement, Sara Clemens, Twitch’s chief operating officer, said QAnon users were only a “small handful” of the seven million people who streamed on the site each month.
“We will take action against users that violate our community policies against harmful content that encourages or incites self-destructive behavior, harassment, or attempts or threatens to physically harm others, including through misinformation,” she said.
Twitch viewers support streamers through monthly subscriptions of $5, $10 or $25 to their channels, or by donating “bits,” a Twitch currency that can be converted to real money. The site also runs advertisements during streams. The platform and streamers split the revenue from ads and subscriptions.
It is difficult to determine how much money individual streamers earn from their Twitch channels, but some of the far-right personalities have made many thousands of dollars.
By viewing chat logs of streams that denote when a new user has subscribed, Ms. Oh has tallied at least $26,000 in subscriptions for Ms. Maras-Lindeman since December and about $5,000 in “bit” donations before Twitch took its cut.
Ms. Weaver has earned nearly $3,000 since she began streaming regularly on Twitch in March, according to Ms. Oh’s tally, and Mr. Paine has made at least $5,000. Those numbers do not account for money made in other ways, such as through Square’s Cash App or Ms. Weaver’s online merchandise store.
Twitch generally has stricter rules than other social media platforms for the kinds of views that users can express. It temporarily suspended Mr. Trump’s account for “hateful conduct” last summer, months before Facebook and Twitter made similar moves. Its community guidelines prohibit hateful conduct and harassment. Ms. Clemens said Twitch was developing a misinformation policy.
This month, Twitch announced a policy that would allow it to suspend the accounts of people who committed crimes or severe offenses in real life or on other social media platforms, including violent extremism or membership in a known hate group. Twitch said it did not consider QAnon to be a hate group.
Despite all this, a Twitch channel belonging to Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys, a white nationalist organization, remained online until the middle of this month after The New York Times inquired about it. And the white nationalist Anthime Joseph Gionet, known as Baked Alaska, had a Twitch channel for months, even though he was arrested in January by the F.B.I. and accused of illegally storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Twitch initially said his activities had not violated the platform’s policies, then barred him this month for hateful conduct.
Ms. Maras-Lindeman and Mr. Paine are Twitch Partners, a coveted status that grants improved customer support and greater options to customize streams. Twitch vets these channels to approve what they do. The company’s website says partners should “act as role models to the community.”
Ms. Maras-Lindeman, who is barred from Twitter, averaged about 3,000 viewers a broadcast in March, and her live video broadcast quickly became one of the 1,200 most popular channels across all of Twitch. Her streams are often akin to extended monologues about current events.
Sometimes, the “O” in her “ToreSays” username is replaced with a fiery “Q,” and she uses the slogan “Where we go one, we go all,” both symbols of the QAnon movement. She has encouraged her viewers to find legal avenues to throw Ohio legislators out of office because, she said, they were elected using illegitimate voting machines.
“You want a great reset? Here it is. We’re going to do it our way, and that’s by eliminating you,” she said during one January stream.
Aside from money made on Twitch, Ms. Maras-Lindeman’s fans donated more than $84,000 for her birthday through a GoFundMe campaign. She said the donations went toward a new car, medical treatments and a lawyer.
In an email, Ms. Maras-Lindeman disputed the characterization of her as a member of the far right and said she did not advocate violence.
“It is not a crime to discuss science and challenge popular current narratives or express my thoughts and opinions,” she said.
On a recent stream, Ms. Maras-Lindeman addressed questions emailed to her for this article. She said she was a “centrist” who was simply encouraging her viewers to become more politically active.
Mr. Paine’s channel has more than 14,000 followers and is rife with conspiracy theories about vaccines and cancer. In one stream, he and a guest encouraged viewers to drink a bleach solution that claims to cure cancer, which the Food and Drug Administration has said is dangerous. Last week, he referred to a QAnon belief that people are killing children to “harvest” a chemical compound from them, then talked about a “criminal cabal” controlling the government, saying people do not understand “what plane of existence they come from.”
Mr. Paine, who is barred from Twitter and YouTube, has also asked his Twitch audience to donate to the House campaign of J.R. Majewski, an Air Force veteran in Toledo, Ohio, who attracted attention last year for painting his lawn to look like a Trump campaign banner. Mr. Majewski has used QAnon hashtags but distanced himself from the movement in an interview with his local newspaper, The Toledo Blade.
Mr. Majewski has appeared on Mr. Paine’s streams, where they vape, chat about Mr. Majewski’s campaign goals and take calls from listeners.
“He is exactly the type of person that we need to get in Washington, D.C., so that we can supplant these evil cabal criminal actors and actually run our own country,” Mr. Paine said on one stream.
Neither Mr. Paine nor Mr. Majewski responded to a request for comment.
Joan Donovan, a Harvard University researcher who studies disinformation and online extremism, said streamers who rely on their audience’s generosity to fund themselves felt pressured to continue raising the stakes.
“The incentive to lie, cheat, steal, hoax and scam is very high when the cash is easy to acquire,” she said.

Full text: Your Friday Evening Briefing

Good evening. Here’s the latest.
1. States are racing to vaccinate as many people as possible as the coronavirus infection curve continues its plateau for a third week.
At least 34 states are giving all adults vaccine access by mid-April, and at least 14 more have announced plans to expand eligibility on or before May 1, a goal set by President Biden. Track your state here. Above, a vaccine clinic in Coraopolis, Pa.
The expansion comes at a critical juncture. The U.S. is logging more than 54,000 new cases per day, a level that health experts warn could rapidly escalate into a new wave.
As U.S. manufacturers hit their stride, vaccine scarcity will soon turn to glut. And then there’s the battle against disinformation: Far-right extremist groups have shifted their focus from “stop the steal” to bashing the safety and efficacy of coronavirus vaccines.
2. Donald Trump is gone from the White House, but Georgia’s crackdown on ballot access proves that his brand of politics remains a political force.
The sweeping bill to restrict voting access, passed by Georgia Republicans on Thursday, was very much in line with Mr. Trump’s false claims that expanded voter access had led to widespread fraud, and, in turn, his defeat. For a second day, President Biden condemned the law and called it “an atrocity.”
A Democratic state legislator was arrested after she lightly knocked on Gov. Brian Kemp’s door as he was signing the bill. Above, protesters in Atlanta on Thursday.
Separately, Fox News is facing a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems over its coverage of the 2020 election. It was previously sued for $2.7 billion by Smartmatic, another voting technology company.
3. With the Suez Canal still blocked by one of the world’s largest container vessels, ships began rerouting around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, which could add weeks to a vessel’s journey.
There are growing signs that efforts to dislodge the ship, Ever Given, may take many days if not weeks. More than 100 vessels are stuck at either end of the canal, above, awaiting clear passage. The fact that one mishap could sow fresh chaos from Los Angeles to Rotterdam to Shanghai underscored the world’s reliance on vulnerable global supply chains.
By land, Egypt is dealing with another crisis: Two trains collided near the city of Sohag, killing at least 32 people and injuring more than 160 when several passenger cars overturned, officials said.
4. We’re still learning more about the fallout from the crippling winter storm that hit Texas last month.
At least 111 people died in the storm, state officials announced Thursday, nearly twice as many as officials had previously estimated. Deaths from the storm had many causes, but most of the victims died as a result of hypothermia.
And as the frigid temperatures froze pipelines and triggered widespread blackouts, drilling companies in the state’s largest oil field were forced to burn off 1.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas in a single day — enough to power 10,000 homes for at least a year. As the state’s power plants went offline and pipelines froze, there was no place to send the gas coming out of the ground, and it had to be set ablaze.
5. Since enacting a national security law last June , the authorities in Hong Kong have moved to quash dissent in the political and educational spheres. Now they’re coming for the arts.
Pro-Beijing lawmakers have called for work by the dissident artist Ai Weiwei to be removed from the M+ museum, slated to open later this year, and a prominent lawmaker said the government should review parts of the museum’s collection, which she described as spreading “hatred” against China. State-owned newspapers have also urged the government to revoke funding from local arts organizations. Above, the temporary venue for M+ in 2017.
“It is possible that artists, especially those who are really critical of society and the political system, won’t be able to get enough resources,” an arts educator said. “They’ll have to go underground.”
6. The N.C.A.A.’s budget for its men’s basketball tournament was nearly double that of its women’s event in 2019, newly revealed financial data shows.
According to a summary prepared by the N.C.A.A., the association budgeted $28 million for the 2019 men’s championship, a 68-team, 67-game tournament that was played in major cities nationwide. The N.C.A.A. budgeted $14.5 million for the women’s championship, a 63-game competition that was also staged across the country.
The gap will assuredly drive questions about the organization’s commitment to gender equity, which has come under fire in recent weeks over its management of this year’s tournaments. The tournaments vary substantially in their formats and popularity, and N.C.A.A. executives insist that those differences necessarily account for their budgeting decisions.
The tournaments move to the Sweet 16 this weekend. Here’s what to watch for from the women’s and the men’s teams.
7. Remembering two literary giants.
Beverly Cleary, whose children’s books were beloved by tens of millions of young readers, died at 104. With characters like Henry Huggins and his dog Ribsy, Ramona Quimby and her older sister Beezus, and other residents of Klickitat Street, Ms. Cleary constructed a world that children recognized — and one that changed with the times.
And Larry McMurtry, the prolific novelist and screenwriter known for “Lonesome Dove” and “Terms of Endearment,” died at 84. Mr. McMurtry demythologized the American West in dozens of novels, essays, memoirs and history, as well as more than 30 screenplays, including “Brokeback Mountain,” adapted from Annie Proulx’s short story. Here’s a look at the trove of work the Pulitzer Prize-winner left behind.
8. Good news for the American bald eagle: The population of birds, once on the brink of extinction, has quadrupled since 2009 in the lower 48 states.
There were an estimated 316,700 bald eagles during the 2019 breeding season, according to a new report by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, up from 72,000 ten years prior. Deb Haaland, the secretary of the Interior, said the results were “truly a historic conservation success story.”
The same can’t be said for Africa’s forest elephants, who have lost nearly nine-tenths of their number in a generation and are now critically endangered — just one step from extinction in the wild.
9. Next year in Jerusalem? At the very least, anywhere but Zoom.
Another trip around the sun during Covid means another year of virtual Passover Seders and smaller gatherings. For the Food contributor Susan Spungen, it’s a good year to try something new and perhaps a bit more exciting than the usual. She developed five Seder dishes you’ll want to eat all the time, like coconut macaroons, above. And if you need more inspiration through out the holiday week, here are 18 recipes to brighten the table.
Here’s how to safely observe upcoming holidays like Passover, Easter and Ramadan.
And consider adding honey to your next evening cocktail. This sometimes overlooked pantry staple has been in the mixologist’s arsenal for generations.
10. And finally, how do you complete Mozart?
It’s hard to imagine a more intimidating task for a musician. But that’s exactly what Timothy Jones, a Mozart expert who teaches at the Royal Academy of Music in London, has done, completing violin sonata fragments that the composer left behind. Listen to them here.
Posthumous completions aren’t uncommon in classical music. But Mr. Jones’s latest effort comes with a twist: He made multiple completed versions of each fragment, each emphasizing different aspects of Mozart’s style.
“Putting the hubris aside,” Mr. Jones said, “I’d much rather Mozart had finished these pieces than I.”
Have a mellifluous weekend.

Full text: Here’s what you need to know at the end of the day.
(Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up .)
Good evening. Here’s the latest.
1. States are racing to vaccinate as many people as possible as the coronavirus infection curve continues its plateau for a third week.
At least 34 states are giving all adults vaccine access by mid-April, and at least 14 more have announced plans to expand eligibility on or before May 1, a goal set by President Biden. Track your state here. Above, a vaccine clinic in Coraopolis, Pa.
The expansion comes at a critical juncture. The U.S. is logging more than 54,000 new cases per day, a level that health experts warn could rapidly escalate into a new wave.
As U.S. manufacturers hit their stride, vaccine scarcity will soon turn to glut. And then there’s the battle against disinformation: Far-right extremist groups have shifted their focus from “stop the steal” to bashing the safety and efficacy of coronavirus vaccines.
2. Donald Trump is gone from the White House, but Georgia’s crackdown on ballot access proves that his brand of politics remains a political force.
The sweeping bill to restrict voting access, passed by Georgia Republicans on Thursday, was very much in line with Mr. Trump’s false claims that expanded voter access had led to widespread fraud, and, in turn, his defeat. For a second day, President Biden condemned the law and called it “an atrocity.”
A Democratic state legislator was arrested after she lightly knocked on Gov. Brian Kemp’s door as he was signing the bill. Above, protesters in Atlanta on Thursday.
Separately, Fox News is facing a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems over its coverage of the 2020 election. It was previously sued for $2.7 billion by Smartmatic, another voting technology company.
3. With the Suez Canal still blocked by one of the world’s largest container vessels, ships began rerouting around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, which could add weeks to a vessel’s journey.
There are growing signs that efforts to dislodge the ship, Ever Given, may take many days if not weeks. More than 100 vessels are stuck at either end of the canal, above, awaiting clear passage. The fact that one mishap could sow fresh chaos from Los Angeles to Rotterdam to Shanghai underscored the world’s reliance on vulnerable global supply chains.
By land, Egypt is dealing with another crisis: Two trains collided near the city of Sohag, killing at least 32 people and injuring more than 160 when several passenger cars overturned, officials said.
4. We’re still learning more about the fallout from the crippling winter storm that hit Texas last month.
At least 111 people died in the storm, state officials announced Thursday, nearly twice as many as officials had previously estimated. Deaths from the storm had many causes, but most of the victims died as a result of hypothermia.
And as the frigid temperatures froze pipelines and triggered widespread blackouts, drilling companies in the state’s largest oil field were forced to burn off 1.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas in a single day — enough to power 10,000 homes for at least a year. As the state’s power plants went offline and pipelines froze, there was no place to send the gas coming out of the ground, and it had to be set ablaze.
5. Since enacting a national security law last June , the authorities in Hong Kong have moved to quash dissent in the political and educational spheres. Now they’re coming for the arts.
Pro-Beijing lawmakers have called for work by the dissident artist Ai Weiwei to be removed from the M+ museum, slated to open later this year, and a prominent lawmaker said the government should review parts of the museum’s collection, which she described as spreading “hatred” against China. State-owned newspapers have also urged the government to revoke funding from local arts organizations. Above, the temporary venue for M+ in 2017.
“It is possible that artists, especially those who are really critical of society and the political system, won’t be able to get enough resources,” an arts educator said. “They’ll have to go underground.”
6. The N.C.A.A.’s budget for its men’s basketball tournament was nearly double that of its women’s event in 2019, newly revealed financial data shows.
According to a summary prepared by the N.C.A.A., the association budgeted $28 million for the 2019 men’s championship, a 68-team, 67-game tournament that was played in major cities nationwide. The N.C.A.A. budgeted $14.5 million for the women’s championship, a 63-game competition that was also staged across the country.
The gap will assuredly drive questions about the organization’s commitment to gender equity, which has come under fire in recent weeks over its management of this year’s tournaments. The tournaments vary substantially in their formats and popularity, and N.C.A.A. executives insist that those differences necessarily account for their budgeting decisions.
The tournaments move to the Sweet 16 this weekend. Here’s what to watch for from the women’s and the men’s teams.
7. Remembering two literary giants.
Beverly Cleary, whose children’s books were beloved by tens of millions of young readers, died at 104. With characters like Henry Huggins and his dog Ribsy, Ramona Quimby and her older sister Beezus, and other residents of Klickitat Street, Ms. Cleary constructed a world that children recognized — and one that changed with the times.
And Larry McMurtry, the prolific novelist and screenwriter known for “Lonesome Dove” and “Terms of Endearment,” died at 84. Mr. McMurtry demythologized the American West in dozens of novels, essays, memoirs and history, as well as more than 30 screenplays, including “Brokeback Mountain,” adapted from Annie Proulx’s short story. Here’s a look at the trove of work the Pulitzer Prize-winner left behind.
8. Good news for the American bald eagle: The population of birds, once on the brink of extinction, has quadrupled since 2009 in the lower 48 states.
There were an estimated 316,700 bald eagles during the 2019 breeding season, according to a new report by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, up from 72,000 ten years prior. Deb Haaland, the secretary of the Interior, said the results were “truly a historic conservation success story.”
The same can’t be said for Africa’s forest elephants, who have lost nearly nine-tenths of their number in a generation and are now critically endangered — just one step from extinction in the wild.
9. Next year in Jerusalem? At the very least, anywhere but Zoom.
Another trip around the sun during Covid means another year of virtual Passover Seders and smaller gatherings. For the Food contributor Susan Spungen, it’s a good year to try something new and perhaps a bit more exciting than the usual. She developed five Seder dishes you’ll want to eat all the time, like coconut macaroons, above. And if you need more inspiration through out the holiday week, here are 18 recipes to brighten the table.
Here’s how to safely observe upcoming holidays like Passover, Easter and Ramadan.
And consider adding honey to your next evening cocktail. This sometimes overlooked pantry staple has been in the mixologist’s arsenal for generations.
10. And finally, how do you complete Mozart?
It’s hard to imagine a more intimidating task for a musician. But that’s exactly what Timothy Jones, a Mozart expert who teaches at the Royal Academy of Music in London, has done, completing violin sonata fragments that the composer left behind. Listen to them here.
Posthumous completions aren’t uncommon in classical music. But Mr. Jones’s latest effort comes with a twist: He made multiple completed versions of each fragment, each emphasizing different aspects of Mozart’s style.
“Putting the hubris aside,” Mr. Jones said, “I’d much rather Mozart had finished these pieces than I.”
Have a mellifluous weekend.

Full text: Here’s what you need to know at the end of the day.
(Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up .)
Good evening. Here’s the latest.
1. Voting rights and immigration dominated President Biden’s first formal news conference.
Speaking at the White House, Mr. Biden called attempts by Republicans to restrict voting “un-American” and vowed to use the power of the presidency to prevent states from making it harder for people to cast ballots.
“This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle,” he said. “I mean, this is gigantic, what they’re trying to do. And it cannot be sustained.”
Mr. Biden was barraged with questions about his handling of the surge of migrants, especially children, at the U.S. border with Mexico. He insisted that officials in his government were doing everything they could to treat migrant children humanely, and he repeatedly blamed former President Donald Trump for the overcrowding in border facilities.
On foreign policy, Mr. Biden said that he could not imagine that U.S. troops would still be in Afghanistan a year from now.
During a question-and-answer session, Mr. Biden said it was his “expectation” that he would run for re-election in 2024, with Vice President Kamala Harris as his running mate.
We fact-checked his news conference here.
2. The new U.S. Covid-19 vaccination goal is 200 million shots in 100 days.
That’s what President Biden said at his news conference, and with 130 million doses already administered, the country is on track to meet it. He said that the pandemic remained the country’s “most urgent problem.” Above, a man in Mississippi receives a Covid shot.
California and Florida announced that more adults will be eligible for vaccines in the coming weeks. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced plans to vaccinate workers in New York City’s theater industry to help Broadway reopen in the fall.
Separately, Pfizer began testing its vaccine on children under 12, following Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, which have all tested vaccines on children in some capacity.
3. The global Covid-19 vaccine rollouts are moving at a snail’s pace, and it isn’t only because of shortages.
In the European Union, bureaucratic inertia, strategic errors, a diffusion of responsibility and logistical problems have all seriously undercut vaccination efforts. Above, a vaccination site in Italy.
Hit by a new wave of infections, India is holding back nearly all of the 2.4 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine that is produced in the country each day, reserving them for domestic needs.
But Britain’s quick rollout of coronavirus vaccines has boosted the political fortunes of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. His allies hope it will vindicate Brexit.
4. The chief executives of Facebook, Twitter and Google were grilled by lawmakers about how disinformation spreads across their platforms.
During a congressional hearing, Democrats accused the executives of allowing disinformation to run rampant, while Republicans focused on the barring of right-wing figures from the platforms, including former President Donald Trump.
When the committee asked Jack Dorsey, above, Twitter’s chief executive, if he believed his company had played a role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, he said, “Yes.” Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, did not answer with a “yes” or “no.”
In other business news , jobless claims dropped to a pandemic low, but economists are concerned about the longer-term displacement of workers.
5. A giant ship blocking the Suez Canal may take days, even weeks, to free.
Dozens of ships are stranded in the canal in Egypt and the economic cost of the disruption grows with each passing hour. Attempts with tugboats and dredgers to dislodge the source of the jam — a ship that’s been wedged in the canal since running aground during a sandstorm on Tuesday — have failed.
Fully loaded with 20,000 containers, the ship “is a very heavy beached whale,” one expert said. So far, the oil market has largely shrugged off the interruption of traffic. Here’s why the Suez Canal is so important.
6. New York reached a deal to legalize recreational marijuana, and become one of the largest markets in the country.
The move paves the way for a potential $4.2 billion industry, with millions of dollars in sales tax revenue reinvested in minority communities each year. Under the deal, deliveries of the drug would be allowed and permits given for marijuana “consumption sites.” New Yorkers would be free to cultivate up to six marijuana plants for personal use. Above, advocates of recreational marijuana in Albany.
Officials hope the measure, if approved, will help end years of racially disproportionate policing that resulted in Black and Hispanic people being arrested on low-level marijuana charges far more frequently than white people.
7. Take the bus. You’ll help the climate.
Public transit offers a relatively simple way for cities to lower their greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, but a year into the pandemic, a severe drop-off in riders has left the systems in many cities hanging by a thread. Above, how transit ridership has changed during the pandemic.
“We are facing maybe the most important crisis in the public transit sector in different parts of the world,” one expert said. If commuters shun public transit for cars as their cities recover, it will have huge implications for air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
8. Eli Kligman, 18, has a shot at playing Major League Baseball, but his devotion to his faith could shatter that dream before it starts.
His strict observance of the Jewish sabbath means he cannot play from Friday night until the sun goes down on Saturday. The solution? Perhaps catching. Professional catchers are given regular days off during the week because of the physical and mental strain. Navigating his career will still be tricky, but Mr. Kligman’s coach thinks he has a chance.
“My goal is to become the first Shabbas observant player in Major League Baseball,” said Mr. Kligman, above during a game in Nevada.
Separately , Black figure skaters, who are both athletes and artists, are using their sport to speak out.
9. Hate speech is rampant on Google Podcasts.
As social networks crack down on hate speech, podcasts are one of the last remaining online mediums for the de-platformed. But even in the world of podcasting, Google Podcasts stands alone for its tolerance of hate speech and other extremist content.
More than two dozen podcasts from white supremacists and pro-Nazi groups were found in a recent search. A Google spokeswoman said that the company did not want to “limit what people are able to find,” and that it only blocks content “in rare circumstances, largely guided by local law.”
“It seems like they’ve made a decision to embrace an audience that wants more offensive content rather than constrain that content for the sake of safety and respect,” ” said Jessica Fjeld, the assistant director of the Cyberlaw Clinic at Harvard.
10. And finally, let’s get nonfungible.
Sophia, above, a robot known for interviewing Germany’s chancellor and performing on “The Tonight Show,” has made a splash in the art world with “Sophia Instantiation” — a 12-second video file of a digital self-portrait. It sold at auction for $688,888.
The sale was the latest in the frenzied market for ownership rights to digital art called NFTs, or “nonfungible tokens,” and possibly the first produced in part by artificial intelligence.
Sophia’s artwork outsold the digital item auctioned off by our tech columnist — his column about NFTs — which fetched over $560,000.
Have a creative evening.

Full text: Geographical barriers, public mistrust delay delivery of doses

The health officials were racing against the clock. Doses of the coronavirus vaccine had to reach Sabang, a city on the mountainous Weh Island in the Andaman Sea, by that afternoon. It was early February, and Indonesia was falling behind on its plan to vaccinate health workers, a crucial step in one of the world's most ambitious immunization campaigns.
The vaccine doses, made by China's Sinovac Biotech, traveled three hours by plane from Jakarta to Banda Aceh but had four hours to go via ferry and armored truck to reach the distribution center.
"It's pretty much a last-minute effort," said Iman Murahman, a spokesman for the Aceh Health Agency. "But I hope we can still be on time."

Coronavirus vaccines offered hope that the world was at the beginning of the end of a pandemic that has taken millions of lives and livelihoods. Indonesia, which has recorded 1.5 million cases and 40,000 deaths, pivoted in recent months from containment to inoculation, betting that vaccines could help reopen the economy, relieve hospitals and protect people across the vast archipelago.
But the first phase of the Sinovac drive in Aceh, the westernmost province of 5 million, has been derailed by misinformation, mistrust and geographical and practical constraints. Aceh and its poor infrastructure have been stretched thin, even with creative solutions such as retrofitting fishery trucks into cold-storage vehicles capable of distributing vaccine doses.
"We need at least 2 million doses per day [across Indonesia] if we want to finish the vaccination drive by next year," said Dicky Budiman, an epidemiologist at Griffith University in Australia, many times the current rate of 400,000 a day.
Slow vaccination pace
In January, Indonesia began rolling out its plan to vaccinate 180 million of its 270 million people, after a late-stage Sinovac trial of 1,600 people in the country showed an efficacy rate of 65.3 percent. The full data has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal or made public by Sinovac, usually a prerequisite for regulatory approval. A Brazilian trial of more than 12,000 health-care volunteers revealed an efficacy rate of just 50.4 percent.
Indonesia has secured commitments for about 330 million vaccines, including 125.5 million doses of Sinovac's CoronaVac, 50 million doses each from Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech, 50 million from Novavax and 54 million doses from the World Health Organization. Only CoronaVac has been distributed so far, with health workers, civil servants and senior citizens first in line.
But at the current pace, it would take Indonesia 10 years to reach its goal. Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said officials should be administering 1 million doses a day but did not elaborate on the capacity to expand the program.
In late February, officials hoping to accelerate the rollout authorized private companies to buy state-procured vaccine doses to offer to employees and their families. Some criticized the move as widening inequality and disrupting access for those who need it most.
"Cooperation between private [companies] and the government is a good move if we want to speed up the vaccination," Pandu Riono, an epidemiologist at the University of Indonesia, said. "But we should focus on the vulnerable and priority groups first."
Overshadowed by skepticism
Indonesia has also struggled to persuade its people to get the shots. A survey by local pollster Saiful Mujani Research and Consulting in December found 23 percent of respondents believed the vaccines were unsafe. Another survey of 1,200 respondents by research center Indikator Politik Indonesia in February found 55 percent would refuse the coronavirus vaccine.
Public skepticism was evident when the Sinovac doses finally made it to Sabang, guarded by a motorcade of police tactical vehicles and men with AK-47s. What was so precious, residents wondered, that it had to be guarded this way?
"As if we would steal the vaccines," said Abdullah, 59, who runs a kiosk selling cigarettes and other small items. Abdullah, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, does not plan to get vaccinated.
Fitriliani, a 26-year-old restaurant owner who also goes by one name, had no idea about the vaccination program.
"I think there's no virus here," she said. "So why do we need vaccination then?"
A survey by the WHO, UNICEF, Indonesia's Health Ministry and the Indonesian Technical Advisory Group on Immunization in September involving more than 100,000 respondents in all 34 provinces found that Aceh had the lowest acceptance rate, at 46 percent.
To assuage doubters, Indonesia's highest clerical body signed off on the vaccine as halal. But the move has had little impact in Aceh, a deeply religious and conservative region of this mostly Muslim country. Rather than social distancing, vaccines or lockdowns, many there said prayer would be the answer.
"We have been through a lot of outbreaks since the era of prophet Muhammad. There is no other cure except prayer and the grace of Allah," said Zakaria, a 53-year-old merry-go-round operator in Banda Aceh who also uses one name.
The central government, meanwhile, moved to penalize those who refuse vaccinations by cutting social assistance or access to public services.
A health worker at the ICU at a hospital in Banda Aceh, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions, said the government left no options for health workers who refused vaccination. "I don't trust the CoronaVac vaccine, but do I have a choice?" she said.
She said she got the shot after Aceh Gov. Nova Iriansyah in February issued a memo, reviewed by The Washington Post, stipulating that health workers who refused vaccination could face termination.
Misinformation and mistrust
While authorities stress that vaccine side effects, such as fatigue and fever, are mostly mild and temporary, many people here worry about serious aftereffects, thanks to disinformation and vague official messaging.
Some have expressed particular concerns about CoronaVac, citing Sinovac's lack of transparency.
For many in Aceh, there is simply no urgency. The province implemented lockdowns and curfew last April but reversed them after a week.
For many here, the coronavirus appears to be a distant memory. Public spaces remain open, and most people do not wear masks. Schools resumed early this year. Many believe simply exercising will help keep the virus away.
"I only trust something that is organic," Putra Siregar, a 27-year-old artist, said. "Even if there is some kind of punishment from the government, I still won't take the vaccine."
Aribowo Sasmito, co-founder of the Indonesia Anti-Slander Society, a nonprofit myth-busting organization, said disinformation has played a role in stymieing the takeup. He said his organization had recorded 712 hoaxes about vaccines between January and November 2020, while the Ministry of Communication and Information documented more than 2,000 hoax topics related to the pandemic.
One anti-vaccine Facebook group, the Anti-Vaccine and Immunization Movement, has nearly 2,800 members and has been active since 2013. In the "About" section, site administrators cite passages from the Koran to justify their beliefs that God has provided humans with enough natural resources to fight off illnesses.
While the group is private, some posts can be viewed publicly. Many are filled with anti-vaccine memes and disinformation.
"We have good Internet penetration in some regions, but it wasn't combined with critical thinking; what we see is a massive influx of hoaxes," Sasmito said. "Good messaging is crucial at this moment."

Full text: with Aaron Schaffer
Anti-vaxxers are attacking pregnant women online for getting coronavirus vaccines. And one of Silicon Valley's biggest critics in the Senate says tech companies aren't doing enough to protect them.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) called out Facebook and Twitter for falling short in addressing posts that could lead to greater vaccine hesitancy in pregnant women, who are at a higher risk for severe illness from contracting the coronavirus.
"Facebook and Twitter's playbook is out-of-date, worn-out, and woefully inadequate toward addressing the horrifying abuse and disinformation that continues to spread like wildfire on their platforms," Blumenthal said in a statement to The Technology 202.
Blumenthal first contacted the two companies last month, following a report in the Daily Beast about people associated with the anti-vaccine movement attacking pregnant women who posted on social media about receiving immunizations. There was even an instance where the anti-vaxxers falsely claimed a woman suffered a miscarriage after receiving a vaccine. In fact, the woman miscarried a month before she got her shot.
He called on the companies to outline the specific steps they were taking to address anti-vaccine groups and pressed them to explain how they were dealing with abuse of expecting mothers receiving the vaccine. But instead he said he received only vague responses from the companies, which pointed to general previoys commitments to combating vaccine misinformation.
"Vague content moderation policies, ineffective fact checking, inconsistent enforcement, and meaningless labels are cold comfort to the women continuously assailed by vile anti-vaccine hate and life-threatening falsehoods," Blumenthal said in a statement. "I see little in their responses that demonstrates these profitable and powerful companies are going to stop treating victims of this abuse like an afterthought."
Anti-vaxxers are taking advantage of uncertainty surrounding coronavirus vaccines.
That is creating a major test of Silicon Valley's promises to spread authoritative information about immunizations.
People trying to undermine public confidence in vaccines are targeting pregnant women as they've been agonizing over whether to get vaccines because there is not yet safety data available about how they affect expecting mothers. With the exception of the smallpox vaccine, immunizations are generally safe for pregnant women and their babies. And experts believe mRNA vaccines, which do not contain live virus, probably would be similar in pregnant and nonpregnant people, my colleague Frances Stead Sellers has reported. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that "people who are pregnant and part of a group recommended to receive the coronavirus vaccine, such as health-care personnel, may choose to be vaccinated." The CDC also says that "mRNA vaccines are not thought to be a risk to the breastfeeding infant." The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists similarly says that "[coronavirus] vaccines should not be withheld from pregnant individuals who meet criteria for vaccination."
And Anthony S. Fauci, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director, said last month that 20,000 pregnant women have been vaccinated without complication.
Yet that's a challenge for Silicon Valley companies, which have very narrow policies about what content they'll take down related to coronavirus vaccines.
Tech companies have developed lists of specific claims they'll remove. For instance, Facebook will take down posts suggesting that vaccines cause autism or that it's better to contract the virus than get a vaccine. But it doesn't have a specific rule to remove posts about pregnant women getting vaccinated.
Instead the company has started labeling posts that make baseless claims about the connection between the vaccine and miscarriage. For instance, Facebook labeled a video that claimed "Pregnant Vaxxers Experience Miscarriage After Covid Vaccine" with a general label indicating "covid-19 vaccines go through many tests for safety and effectiveness before they're approved," citing the World Health Organization. It's also applied labels from independent fact checkers, who warned miscarriage reports are not proof the vaccines pose a danger to pregnancy.
Twitter is taking a similar approach, and also applied a label to a tweet claiming that the vaccine was not safe for pregnant women after contacted by The Technology 202. Twitter's warning directly said the tweet was misleading, and directed people to "find out why health officials consider covid-19 vaccines safe for most people."
Blumenthal's criticism of the companies underscores the growing political pressure on social networks not to be a conduit for misinformation about the coronavirus.
Lawmakers' concerns could undermine the public promise tech giants are making to be part of the vaccination efforts. Blumenthal's statement came the same day Mark Zuckerberg authored a blog post outlining Facebook's work to support efforts to end the pandemic, including launching a tool to help people find out where they can get the vaccine.
Our top tabsA trove of memos reveals how Washington squandered its opportunity to take on Google in 2013.
The internal memos reveal that Federal Trade Commission lawyers and economic experts made contradictory assumptions, which ultimately turned out to be incorrect about the future of the Internet and Google's treatment of its rivals, Politico's Leah Nylen reports. The documents raise questions about whether federal regulators are able to take on tech giants today, even as lawmakers and the Biden administration increase scrutiny of Big Tech.
The FTC's predictions missed the mark on where technology was moving:
The staffers incorrectly assumed there was "limited potential for growth" in ads tracking people across the Internet. Those now drive Alphabet's $182.5 billion in annual revenue.
They incorrectly assumed people would primarily use search engines on computers rather than smartphones. Today 62 percent of searches take place on mobile phones and tablets, nearly all of which use Google's search engine as the default due to partnerships the company struck.
They predicted Microsoft, Mozilla or Amazon would compete in mobile operating systems. But Apple and Google continue to dominate mobile phones in the United States.
They underestimated Google's market share, and the power that gave it over rival companies.
Facebook struck a deal to pay to distribute news in Australia after a standoff with the government.
News conglomerate News Corp. and Facebook reached a multiyear agreement that covers the corporation's major Australian and regional newspapers, the Associated Press's Rod McGuirk reports. The deal comes as big technology companies, including Google, race to strike agreements with publishers after Australia passed laws that would require the tech giants to contribute to the cost of journalism.
"The agreement with Facebook is a landmark in transforming the terms of trade for journalism, and will have a material and meaningful impact on our Australian news businesses," News Corp. CEO Robert Thomson said in a statement. Thompson also thanked Australia for "taking a principled stand for publishers."
The agreement marks a reversal for Facebook, which initially protested the law by cutting off news pages in the country. The company later restored access after striking a deal with Australia's government.
Uber and Lyft drivers received millions in loans during the pandemic, showing how gig workers rely on the government.
Tens of thousands of drivers received at least $80 million from little-known government grant and loan programs, making them among the programs' largest beneficiaries, Faiz Siddiqui and Andrew Van Dam report. 
The drivers benefited from the Small Business Administration's Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. They qualified because they are classified as independent contractors, a designation that companies such as Uber and Lyft have fought hard to maintain. The SBA released the data after The Washington Post and 10 news organizations filed a federal lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act.
SBA spokeswoman Tiffani Shea Clements said that loans for gig workers identified by The Post made up a tiny fraction of loans and funding provided by the agency. Uber spokesman Matthew Wing pointed to the company's efforts to support drivers, while Lyft spokeswoman Julie Wood pointed to arguments that the company's drivers prefer to be classified as independent contractors.
Gab, a right-wing social media network, spiked in popularity amid the Capitol riot.
Hacked data from the social media network shows the site's popularity spiked in the days following the attacks, as major tech companies cracked down on Parler, another social network favored by conservatives, the Intercept's Micah Lee reports. An additional 2.4 million Gab accounts were created between Jan. 6 and Feb. 19, up from 1.6 million accounts that Gab had on the day of the insurrection.
The leaked data was downloaded by activist hackers who breached the site last month. It also shows the sprawling influence of baseless claims on Gab, including those linked to QAnon, an extremist ideology that the FBI has deemed a domestic terrorism threat.
Accounts whose data was compromised in the hack include Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who spoke positively about QAnon before distancing herself from the movement. Users also sent messages about violence amid the Capitol riot, Lee reports.
Amazon is expanding its program to gamify work at its warehouses amid a unionization drive.
The company's FC Games program, which offers warehouse workers rewards for competing in games to boost efficiency, has been rolled out to the company's warehouses in 20 states, the Information's Paris Martineau and Mark Di Stefano report. The expansion comes as the company is increasingly scrutinized for safety practices and its treatment of workers in the warehouses.
One warehouse worker compared the games to "Black Mirror," a dystopian television show. In one episode of the series, workers ride bicycles to earn credits. Another worker told the Information that some people haven't played the games because they are concerned that they will hurt themselves by overworking.
"Employees have told us they enjoy having the option to join in these workstation games, and we're excited to be taking their feedback and expanding the program to even more buildings throughout our network," said Kent Hollenbeck, an Amazon spokesman. "Even with this expansion, the program remains completely optional for employees; they can switch in or out of different games depending on their preference, can play anonymously, or not play at all — the choice is theirs."

Full text: with Mariana Alfaro
Welcome to The Daily 202 newsletter ! Today, we look at what President Biden promised in his first prime-time speech. But don't miss the latest on the administration's first talks with China, and the efforts to get millions more vaccinated. Send me links to politics or policy stories you think deserve more attention! And tell your friends to sign up here .
President Biden promised in his first prime-time address last night to own it if the sweeping rescue package he signed hours earlier falls short of its ambitious goals of smothering the pandemic and breathing new life into the economy.
Speaking from the East Room of the White House 50 days after taking office, Biden promised the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan would fund initiatives to "beat the virus and create millions of jobs."
And the president, simultaneously taking both credit and responsibility, declared: "If it fails at any point, I will acknowledge that it failed."
“But it will not,” he promised.
Biden has generally set, and met,realistic goals in his first 50 days. But the promises he made in his speech — even as heavily qualified as they were — come with political risks should he fall short. Think "Mission Accomplished," "you'll be able to keep your doctor," or predicting coronavirus cases will soon be "close to zero."
The White House had previewed the biggest news from the speech.
As my colleague Sean Sullivan wrote:
"President Biden on Thursday directed states to ensure that all adults are eligible for thecoronavirusvaccine by May 1, and he declared a goal of allowing small celebrations on July 4, setting up significant landmarks in the effort to return to normalcy after the devastating pandemic."
At the New York Times,Michael Shear put it this way:
"President Biden on Thursday evening directed states to make all adult Americans eligible to receive coronavirus vaccines no later than May 1, using a somber but hopeful prime-time address to the nation to say Americans may be able to 'mark our independence from this virus' by the Fourth of July."
As Agence France-Presse's Sebastian Smith saw it:
"President Joe Biden on Thursday offered his COVID-weary nation a tantalizing glimpse of an almost normal July 4th, outlining in a speech how the United States can defeat the coronavirus if people stay united on prevention measures and get vaccinated."
Here areLauren Egan, Kristen Welker and Shannon Pettypiece of NBC News:
"President Joe Biden announced Thursday that he will direct states to make all adults eligible forcoronavirusvaccinations no later than May 1, a move that he said could help the United States return to some sense of normalcy by Independence Day."
Univision also highlighted May 1 and July 4:
"El mandatario planteó dos fechas específicas para marcar el camino a la normalidad: el 1 de mayo y el 4 de julio,el Día de la Independencia, cuando promete que los estadounidenses (si la ciencia lo permitey los CDC lo aconsejan) podrán reunirse con familias y amigos para los tradicionales asados y festividades de la jornada."
Whereas former president Donald Trump one year ago pushed for "packed churches" by Easter, Biden instead was more modest but no less concrete in his ambitions. Biden envisioned small groups of families and friends gathered to "not only mark our independence as a nation but we begin to mark our independence from this virus."
By picking a date by which Americans can judge whether their lives are back to normal, and by claiming personal responsibility for the rescue package's success, Biden has set precise benchmarks to which voters can hold him.
Biden opened his remarks with transparent swipes at Trump — not by name — for what he described as deadly early missteps in confronting the novel coronavirus that has killed more than 530,000 people in the United States.
"A year ago, we were hit with a virus that was met with silence and spread unchecked, denials for days, weeks, then months," he said. "That led to more deaths, more infections, more stress, and more loneliness."
Trump regularly, and falsely, portrayed the coronavirusas no worse than the flu; later admitted he had deliberately beenplaying down the threat;condemned efforts to contain the virus by closing businesses; played down mask-wearing andonce famously declared "I don't take responsibility at all" for testing failures. Still, Biden has been taking credit for initiativeslaunched on Trump's watch andinflating his predecessor's failures.
Where Trump regularly blamed "the China virus" — he used the incendiary term, which some blame for violence against Asian Americans,as recently as Wednesday — Biden denounced "vicious hate crimes against Asian Americans, who have been attacked, harassed, blamed and scapegoated."
“It's wrong. It's un-American. And it must stop,” he said.
And the president had strong words of warning, perhaps intended forstates easing lockdowns and mask-wearing mandates or Americans resisting steps like mask-wearing or social distancing.
"If we don't stay vigilant, and the conditions change, then we may have to reinstate restrictions to get back on track," Biden said. "We don't want to do that again. We've made so much progress. This is not the time to let up."
What’s happening nowTHE DAM IS BREAKING
The political winds are shifting, fast, in the Empire State where a slew of New York House Democrats – including Reps. Jerry Nadler, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jamaal Bowman, Grace Meng, and Mondaire Jones – called for Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to resign following accusations of sexual harassment. And Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee head Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) just released a statement calling on Cuomo to resign, saying "women deserve to be heard" and that the governor needs to be focused full-time on the battle to "crush" coronavirus.
All eyes are now on Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Kristen Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).
A majority of New York's House delegation has now called for Cuomo to step down and it seems like more statements are probably coming. "The repeated accusations against the governor, and the manner in which he has responded to them, have made it impossible for him to continue to govern at this point," Nadler said.
Jones said Cuomo is "unfit" to continue governing, adding his "mismanagement of covid-19 spread in nursing homes and subsequent attempt to cover it up cost lives and has decimated the public's faith in our state government."
"We believe these women, we believe the reporting, we believe the Attorney General, and we believe the fifty-five members of the New York State legislature, including the State Senate Majority Leader, who have concluded that Governor Cuomo can no longer effectively lead," Ocasio-Cortez and Bowman said.
New York Senate Deputy Majority Leader Mike Gianaris said the entire Long Island state Senate delegation agreed Cuomo should resign.
In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio also called on Cuomo to resign.Cuomo, he said, has shown a "pattern of cover up and a pattern of lies." "The governor must resign," he added, per the Times's Emma Fitzsimmons. "He can no longer do the job."
Context: Cuomo faces accusations of sexual harassment from six former employees.
But: not all state Democratic female officials are behind throwing Cuomo out before an investigation is complete, per a story by our Michael Scherer.
And: In the days after Cuomo was first accused by a former aide, "the governor's office called at least six former employees either to find out if they had heard from the accuser or to glean information about her in conversations that some said they saw as attempts to intimidate them," the Wall Street Journal reports.
Meanwhile, this Times reporter points out Cuomo has no public events for today on his schedule:
Attention Trumpworld: Cyrus Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney leading an investigation into Trump's businesses, will not run for reelection.Vance's departure means Trump will likely face a new adversary, The New York Times's Jonah Bromwich reports, since the investigation will be left in a newcomer's hands. "The many candidates clamoring to replace him are, with few exceptions, seeking to fundamentally reshape the office," Bromwich writes about the eight-way race to replace Vance.
Biden will celebrate the passage of his $1.9 trillion relief package with a Rose Garden event with congressional Democrats today at 2:30 p.m.. Next week, the president embarks on a cross-country tour to sell the sweeping new law to Americans, John Wagner, Felicia Sonmez and Colby Itkowitz report.
Biden and Harris met virtually this morning with their counterparts in an alliance known as the Quad: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison; and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. "On this moment, it's a purpose that I think we all are concerned about. A free and open Indo-Pacific is essential to each of our futures, our countries," Biden said during the meeting, but neither he nor the other leaders directly discussed threats to maritime movement, economic expansion or diplomatic success posed by authoritarian China, Anne Gearan reports.
Suga will be the first foreign leader to visit Biden in person. The meeting demonstrates Biden's focus on rebuilding U.S. influence in Asia and rebuffing China, Anne Gearan reports. No date was announced for the visit, and an administration official said the details will be determined by progress against the pandemic.
ICE is asking officers to deploy to the border "as soon as this weekend" to care for soaring numbers of migrant families, teens and children.In an urgent email sent to senior staff last night, ICE asked for volunteers to quickly move to the border, where holding cells are crammed beyond capacity, Nick Miroff reports.

Lunchtime reads from The Post
"The billionaire boom,"by Nitasha Tiku and Jay Greene: "The wealth of nine of the country's top titans has increased by more than $360 billion in the past year. And they are all tech barons, underscoring the power of the industry in the U.S. economy. … The scrutiny of tech billionaires' wealth is also driven by the role their companies played during the pandemic. Social media including Facebook [run by Mark Zuckerberg] appeared to make the situation worse because it was used to spread disinformation … [Tesla CEO Elon] Musk railed against stay-at-home mandates … In [Jeff] Bezos's case, profits were possible in part because Amazon hired more than 500,000 workers to stow, sort, pick and pack goods in 2020, even as warehouse workers sounded alarms about safety."
"The Biden administration's first showdown with China,"by Ishaan Tharoor: "Next week in Alaska, top officials in the Biden administration are slated to have face-to-face meetings with Chinese counterparts. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and President Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, will sit down with China's most senior foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, and Chinese State Councilor Wang Yi next Thursday in Anchorage. … There are no high expectations for the Alaska talks."
… and beyond
"CDC's 'Huge Mistake': Did misguided mask advice drive up Covid death toll for health workers?" by Kaiser Health News's Christina Jewett: "Since the start of the pandemic, the most terrifying task in health care was thought to be when a doctor put a breathing tube down the trachea of a critically ill covid patient. Those performing such 'aerosol-generating' procedures, often in an intensive care unit, got the best protective gear even if there wasn't enough to go around, per CDC guidelines. And for anyone else working with covid patients, until a month ago, a surgical mask was considered sufficient. A new wave of research now shows that several of those procedures were not the most hazardous. Recent studies have determined that a basic cough produces about 20 times more particles than intubation."
"The one union Biden has not supported,"by the American Prospect's Marcia Brown: "The National Association of Immigration Judges (NAIJ), a union that represents the nation's 500 judges, outspokenly opposed the [Trump] administration's efforts at every turn. In 2019, the Trump administration moved to decertify the immigration judges' union … The union is hopeful that President Biden will reverse the decision, but they have yet to see action."
"How four business owners persevered through the pandemic,"by the Washington City Paper's Laura Hayes: "When Sunyatta Amen opened Calabash Tea & Tonic in 2015, she envisioned it as a modern-day apothecary. … The pandemic decimated Calabash's revenue, but the business survived thanks to a Paycheck Protection Program loan, a shift to e-commerce, and teaming up with other local businesses … to sell goods … Closing [a location in] Shaw was an easy call for Amen because the shop is tight and the windows don't open. 'I was concerned about my staff and their families,' she says. '… We don't want to kill grandma trying to catch a dollar.'"
The first 100 daysStimulus checks are expected to start landing in Americans’ bank accounts this weekend.
That is according to White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who said Americans can expect the "first wave" of checks in the next few days and that they will continue flowing over "the next several weeks."
Michelle Singletary, our personal finance columnist, writes those who've filed their 2019 or 2020 tax returns and received a refund should be the first in line to get a payment, since the IRS has their direct deposit information.
But, but, but: An overworked IRS — which is currently in the middle of tax season — could lead to a backlog in processing both tax returns and stimulus checks. As Lisa Rein reported in January, the pandemic has "magnified critical weaknesses" in an agency plagued by "old technology and understaffing."
And while the checks are coming soon, for some, it is too late — and not enough.
"No state's work force has been battered as badly by the coronavirus pandemic as Nevada's, and people are especially struggling in Las Vegas," reports the New York Times's Jennifer Medina. Because of the state's heavy reliance on tourism, service industry workers have gone months without stable incomes. MaryAnn Bautista, a hotel worker and a "single mother of five … [who has] received unemployment checks within weeks … said she would spend her stimulus money stocking up on food and helping her children out with their bills. 'We appreciate the help,' she said of the government aid. 'Don't get me wrong. We do appreciate that, but we cannot rely on it. We want job assurance.' "
States with Republican governors had the highest covid-19 incidence and death rates over the summer, per a new study.
A new study by Johns Hopkins University and the Medical University of South Carolina found that, "the per-capita rates of new COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 deaths were higher in states with Democrat governors in the first months of the pandemic last year, but became much higher in states with Republican governors by mid-summer and through 2020."
"For death rates, Republican-led states had lower rates early in the pandemic, but higher rates from July 4 through mid-December," researchers found.
The U.S. is sitting on tens of millions of vaccine doses that the rest of the world needs.
Doses of the vaccine made by AstraZeneca "are sitting idly in American manufacturing facilities, awaiting results from its U.S. clinical trial while countries that have authorized its use beg for access," the Times's Noah Weiland and Rebecca Robbins report. At least 30 million doses are waiting approval in Ohio, and a company in Maryland has produced enough vaccine for tens of millions more doses.
"AstraZeneca has asked the Biden administration to let it loan American doses to the European Union, where it has fallen short of its original supply commitments and where the vaccination campaign has stumbled badly," Weiland and Robbins write. "The administration, for now, has denied the request."
What’s next for Democrats? Confronting the filibuster.
"Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer and his fellow Senate Democrats now face a pivotal decision: What's next for the filibuster? On one hand, Democrats are under pressure to deliver on key priorities for their party's liberal base, and the House has begun to stack partisan bills at the Senate's door. On the other hand, some Democratic senators are hoping to embrace a more bipartisan mode of lawmaking," Mike DeBonis and Seung Min Kim report.
While the Senate is expected to spend the rest of March filling out Biden's Cabinet, it will take up new legislative business in April — and Schumer has already said he is committed to passing a "big bold agenda," and he is not waiting for Republicans.
Republicans haven't yet blocked a Democratic bill in the evenly split Senate, but "a large and growing number of Democrats are itching for a fight" — including Schumer.
Remember the holdouts:Sens. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) and Krysten Sinema (Ariz.) are the two Democrats who will oppose eliminating the filibuster — at least for now. "While Manchin has openly pondered changes to the rule, Sinema recently told constituents in a letter that she supported preserving it as a means to 'protect what the Senate was designed to be.' "
What’s next for Biden? Immigration and infrastructure.
"The White House so far has not said what Biden will turn to next as part of his legislative agenda," Kim reports. But Psaki signaled both immigration and infrastructure are top priorities. Whatever Biden's next plans may be, they are already running into trouble.
On infrastructure: "The White House has declined to say whether Biden would be open to the fast-track parliamentary measure used for coronavirus relief — called reconciliation — on infrastructure, with officials noting that the president hasn't even proposed a bill. But two of the most influential forces in the Senate Democratic caucus are colliding on strategy. [Manchin] is insisting that Democrats avoid using reconciliation on infrastructure … [While] Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) … signaled that doing so would be the only way of getting a meaningful infrastructure package accomplished."
On immigration:"The prospects of Biden's immigration bill surviving through Congress intact appear increasingly bleak. House Democratic leaders have privately started to gauge the level of support for the president's plan — formally called the U.S. Citizenship Act — and found that, at this point, it would struggle to pass. … Many lawmakers also feel that such a massive overhaul is moving too quickly in the House, while moderates fear supporting controversial legislation that has no real path in the Senate."
Biden's immigration goals still have a lifeline:"While they sort through internal dynamics on the broader overhaul, House Democratic leaders will move smaller, more targeted legislation that would offer a pathway to citizenship for beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and immigrants who have been shielded from deportation under temporary protected status. House Democrats will also pass legislation that offers green cards to farmworkers who don't have legal status."
Biden's immigration plan would eventually allow most undocumented immigrants to become citizens.Daniela Santamariña, Danielle Rindler and Joe Fox explain how:

More than 5,800 employees in that Amazon facility are in the middle of a major union drive. Sanders also called on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to testify. "What you are seeing right now in Bessemer is an example of the richest person in this country spending a whole lot of money to make it harder for ordinary working people to live with dignity and safety," Sanders told Jay Greene. Bezos had not replied to the request to testify by yesterday afternoon, Sanders said. (Bezos owns The Post).

Tucker Carlson is now feuding with the Pentagon.This week, Carlson criticized Biden's announcement that the military is developing new uniforms to accommodate women's hairstyles and pregnancies. "So we've got new hairstyles and maternity flight suits," said Carlson, per the New York Post. "Pregnant women are going to fight our wars. It's a mockery of the US military."
Pentagon spokesman John Kirby pushed back against Carlson's comments, saying the military "is the greatest the world has ever seen because of its diversity. "What we absolutely won't do is take personnel advice from a talk show host or the Chinese military. Maybe those folks feel like they have something to prove — that's on them," he said.

Black and Hispanic Communities Grapple With Vaccine Misinformation

Full text: The false information arrives on social media and fringe news sites, influencing people already facing other hurdles to getting vaccinated. Some activists are going door to door to counter it.
SAN JOSE, Calif. — On an unseasonably warm day in February, two men working with a local community group went door to door in an ethnically diverse neighborhood to persuade people to sign up for Covid-19 vaccinations.
It was just after 11 a.m. when they encountered the first person reluctant to get a shot. Two doors down and 30 minutes later, it happened again. For nearly an hour, they stood on a front lawn with George Rodriguez, 67, chatting about the neighborhood, the pandemic and the available vaccines.
“I see all this stuff online, about how it’s going to change my DNA. It does something to your DNA, right?” asked Mr. Rodriguez, who is Hispanic. “There is just too much stuff out, too much conflicting information. And then I hear that even if you get the vaccine you can still get sick. Why would I get it, then?”
Black and Hispanic communities, which were hit harder by the pandemic and whose vaccination rates are lagging that for white people, are confronting vaccine conspiracy theories, rumors and misleading news reports on social media outlets like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter and in private online messaging, health authorities and misinformation researchers said.
The misinformation varies, like claims that vaccines can alter DNA — which is not true — and that the vaccines don’t work, or that people of color are being used as guinea pigs. A good part of this incorrect information comes from friends, family and celebrities, bubbling up in communities that have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic and facing other hurdles to getting vaccinated.
Foreign news outlets and anti-vaccine activists have also aggressively tried to cast doubt on the safety and efficacy of vaccines made in the United States and Europe.
Misinformation has complicated efforts by some states to reach out to Black and Hispanic residents, particularly when health officials have provided special registration codes for vaccine appointments. Instead of a benefit, in some cases the codes have become the basis for new false narratives.
“What might look like, on the surface, as doctors prioritizing communities of color is being read by some people online as ‘Oh, those doctors want us to go first to be the guinea pigs,’” said Kolina Koltai, a researcher at the University of Washington who studies online conspiracy theories. “I’ve seen people on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Clubhouse — you name it — saying the codes are a way to force the vaccine on communities of color as an experiment.”
Research conducted by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation in mid-February showed a striking disparity between racial groups receiving the vaccine in 34 states that reported the data.
The state figures vary widely. In Texas, where people who identify as Hispanic make up 42 percent of the population, only 20 percent of the vaccinations had gone to that group. In Mississippi, where Black people make up 38 percent of the population, they received 22 percent of the vaccinations. According to an analysis by The New York Times, the vaccination rate for Black Americans is half that of white people, and the gap for Hispanic people is even larger.
While researchers say a lack of easy access to vaccine sites could be the biggest driver of that shortfall, misinformation is playing a role.
The belief that doctors are interested in experimenting on certain communities has deep roots among some groups, Ms. Koltai said. Anti-vaccine activists have drawn on historical examples, including Nazi doctors who ran experiments in concentration camps, and the Baltimore hospital where, 70 years ago, cancer cells were collected from Henrietta Lacks, a Black mother of five, without her consent.
“The thing about misinformation is that it works best when it is built around a kernel of truth. In this case, many communities of color don’t trust the medical establishment because they don’t have the best history with it,” said Shireen Mitchell, founder of Stop Online Violence Against Women, a group that supports women of color who are harassed online.
An experiment begun in 1932 on nearly 400 Black men in Tuskegee, Ala., is one of the most researched examples of medical mistreatment of the Black community. Over four decades, scientists observed the men, whom they knew were infected with syphilis, but didn’t offer treatments so that they could study the disease’s progression. When the experiment came to light in the 1970s, it was condemned by the medical community as a major violation of ethical standards.
Researchers who study disinformation followed mentions of Tuskegee on social media over the last year. While Tuskegee averaged several hundred mentions a week on Facebook and Twitter, there were several noticeable spikes that coincided with the introduction of Covid-19 vaccines, according to Zignal Labs, a media insights company.
The final week of November, when the pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer announced promising results in their final studies on the safety of their Covid-19 vaccines, mentions of Tuskegee climbed to 7,000 a week.
There was another lull until mid-December, when the Food and Drug Administration announced it had given emergency approval to the vaccines. Mentions of Tuskegee climbed to nearly 5,000 that week, according to Zignal, with some of the most viral tweets calling the coronavirus vaccines “the New Tuskegee study.”
Doctors say they are battling vaccine hesitancy in other demographic groups, as well. Last month, a poll by the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 23 percent of Republicans said they would “definitely” not get vaccinated, while 21 percent said they “probably” would not get a coronavirus vaccine.
Native American groups have been battling vaccine fears in their communities, and doctors have reported that some of their Chinese-American patients have been bringing in articles in Chinese-language media outlets questioning vaccines made in the United States.
Many Black and Hispanic people were already struggling to make appointments and reach vaccination sites that are often in whiter, wealthier neighborhoods. And officials in some cities say that people from those neighborhoods also have been flooding vaccination appointment systems and taking supply intended for poorer Black and Hispanic residents.
Misinformation about who is allowed to receive the vaccine, when it is available and how it was safety tested has added even more difficulty, Ms. Mitchell said.
At a mass vaccination site at the Oakland Coliseum on a recent Friday afternoon, before 68-year-old Anthony Jones agreed to get his shot last month, there was just one last thing he wanted to look up on Facebook. He pulled out his phone and started to tap, waving off his grandson, who had driven him to his appointment.
“I read something about a woman who died from this thing, and I want to know if she was Black,” said Mr. Jones, who after several minutes of scrolling could not find the Facebook post he was looking for. “You see a lot of stuff on the internet which makes you think, as a Black man, you should not be taking this vaccine.”
Mr. Jones eventually gave up. As he was walking in for his shot he remembered the article he had seen was on WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, and from a website he didn’t recognize.
“My grandson tells me not to believe everything I read on the internet,” he said. “I like to believe my grandson.”
The next day, Daniel Lander, 38, was canvassing a neighborhood in San Jose with Armando Mateos, 28. For the last five months, Mr. Lander has been going door to door in a program managed by Working Partnerships USA, a community organization based in Silicon Valley. The group is working with local county officials to help dispel misinformation about the pandemic and vaccines.
“We hear people say that they saw this or that celebrity sharing something on Twitter or Instagram that made them think the vaccine was a bad idea. People value the opinion of people they look up to, and these celebrities have a lot of influence,” Mr. Lander said.
As they chatted with Mr. Rodriguez, a muscular man and an enthusiastic talker, Mr. Lander and Mr. Mateos said they sympathized with his concerns. They said they had a lot of the same questions, and explained their decision to get the vaccines themselves. Mr. Rodriguez asked where they got their shots and how it made them feel.
Mr. Mateos reflexively touched his left arm, where he had received the vaccine in recent weeks. It hurt, he said, and he wasn’t going to sugarcoat it. But he was convinced that it was safe, and that it would keep him and his loved ones from getting sick.
“They’ve read all this stuff online, from different news sources, which is confusing. But then they meet me, as someone who has had the shot, and I can give them some real answers,” Mr. Mateos said. He added that many people cited articles in the Spanish-language versions of Russian state-backed media networks, Sputnik and Russia Today. “They are very down on the American vaccines. People read those stories and don’t want to get the shot.”
As the two men were leaving, Mr. Rodriguez yelled out that he would get the shot that week. They made sure he had the phone number and websites he needed to register, and continued down the street.
“I think I will get it later this week,” Mr. Rodriguez said. “I don’t make promises, but I think that they’ve convinced me.”

Full text: How other countries' efforts to control the internet compare with China's Great Firewall.
This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it weekdays.
China's government commands the "Great Firewall," an elaborate system of technology and people that blocks foreign websites, contorts online conversations and punishes people for straying.
I spoke with my colleague Paul Mozur, who has written for years about technology and politics in China, about what he called "firewalls great and small" by governments in Myanmar, Russia, Uganda and other countries that are to varying degrees also trying to control online activities.
Shira: Please first explain China's system of internet control.
Paul: It's a combination of blocking just about any foreign website you can think of and providing an information environment that reinforces what China's government and the Chinese Communist Party say about the world.
The controls are comprehensive. A huge government bureaucracy monitors online activity, and an army of volunteers report content to be censored and help spread positive messages about government initiatives. Companies are tasked with pulling material off the internet, and engineering teams are dispatched to build artificial intelligence tools to help. Contractors provide the manpower for industrial scale censorship.
The newest phenomenon is the internet police, which detains or investigates people if they're found to routinely do things like make fun of China's leader, Xi Jinping, online or raise sensitive political topics.
Does the firewall work?
Yes. It comes at the cost of the government's energy and money and the permanent anger of a segment of the population, but it's extremely effective in shaping what many think.
Most people don't have time to escape the information environment they live in, so it informs their outlook on the world -- especially during crises. The online manipulation during the early coronavirus outbreak was probably the biggest censorship event in history.
How do other countries' efforts to block some websites or control the internet compare with the Great Firewall?
Iran and North Korea also have nearly complete control over the internet, and Myanmar and Cambodia are potentially trying to do something similar.
But it's difficult for any country to permanently block major social media sites and censor what people say online -- as our colleague Anton Troianovski has reported from Russia. It risks angering citizens and isolating the economy, and the government risks missing its other priorities. It's also difficult to stay on top of people's attempts around the internet controls.
How has Myanmar tried to control people's online activities?
When the coup started last month, the military used brute force tactics to simply blackout the internet temporarily. In some cases, they did it at gunpoint. Now they're slowly cutting access.
Each morning, people wake up to find new websites they can't access. For now, it has been fairly easy for people to get around those blocks. The worry is that new technology from China could make the blocks more complete, though we've seen no evidence to date of China's involvement.
How do you explain that in Myanmar people have suffered from too little restraint of the internet and also too much? First, the military spread hatred online against the country's Rohingya minority group, and now it's cutting off the internet.
Where democratic institutions are weak and there are challenges over a country's future, powerful actors will both cut off the flow of information when it suits them and deploy the internet to spread information in their interests. China does both, and so has Myanmar. Though it might seem contradictory, censorship and disinformation go hand in hand.
What's next?
The fear is that China will make the technology and techniques of its internet manipulation system readily adaptable by other autocratic countries. Myanmar is important to watch because if the generals control the internet without decimating the economy, it may become a model for other authoritarian regimes.
Three cheap and helpful tech gadgets
Flying cars are great, but sometimes finding technology that tackles small problems can feel amazing. The New York Times personal tech columnist Brian X. Chen has three inexpensive tech helpers for us to try.
Sometimes the most useful technologies are cheap gizmos combined with human ingenuity. Here are three examples in the $ 15 to $ 30 range.
Bluetooth trackers like Tile ( $ 25): These tiny tags are meant to be attached to things that you frequently misplace, like your house keys and wallet, so that you can use your phone to pinpoint them. But with a bit of imagination, Bluetooth trackers can do much more.
I attach a Tile to my obnoxiously thin Apple TV remote, which regularly disappears between couch cushions. I leave a Tile in my checked luggage to help me find it at the airport. And a friend who leaves a Tile in her car was able to track down the thieves who stole it and share that information with law enforcement.
We've written extensively about the dangers of allowing third parties to track our location, but privacy experts have not found major concerns with Tile's practices.
MyQ smart garage door opener ( $ 27): This hub, when installed next to your existing garage door opener and connected to a home internet network, lets anyone control the garage door with a phone app.
I've found this gizmo surprisingly useful. Once, when I wasn't home, my neighbor locked himself out of our building, and I was able to let him in by using the app to remotely open the garage door. It's also great that my wife and I don't need separate remote controls when we pull our bicycles out of the garage for a ride.
Internet-connected plugs like TP-Link's Kasa ( $ 17): I use smart plugs to program a bunch of small tasks. I schedule a grow light for my homegrown vegetables to turn off after 16 hours and program an electric kettle to boil water first thing in the morning for coffee.
Before we go ...
Must we program JavaScript to get a shot? My colleague Kellen Browning reported that many older Americans are at a disadvantage in tackling the maze of websites, Twitter alerts and other tech know-how that are required to register for coronavirus vaccines.
A middle ground on tech regulation may be possible: Kashmir Hill wrote about Massachusetts, where a civil liberties activist and elected officials struck a balance between banning facial recognition technology used by law enforcement and giving the police complete free rein.
The internet never forgets: Liat Kaplan, who wrote a formerly anonymous celebrity blog in the 2010s, has second thoughts about "vengeful public shaming masquerading as social criticism." Related, from the internet culture writer Ryan Broderick: "We can't control how much of our lives exist in near-permanence online, but we can learn to decide what's worth dissecting and what's not."

Full text: with Alexandra Ellerbeck
Xavier Becerra, President Biden's nominee for secretary of health and human services, will face two main attacks as he sits in Senate confirmation hearings this week: that he's unqualified and that he's an activist.
The first argument may be harder for Republicans to make than the second.
California's attorney general is likely to be confirmed as HHS secretary — but it’s not guaranteed.
Conservative groups are pouring money into fighting his confirmation. Becerra led dozens of lawsuits against Trump administration rules on health care, the environment, immigration and other topics, placing California at the center of high-profile legal tussles that pitted progressive ideologies against conservative ones.
Heritage Action, Judicial Crisis Network and Americans for Public Trust are spending hundreds of thousands on ads against Becerra. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) is running digital advertisements in Georgia and New Hampshire, pressuring lawmakers there to vote against confirming Becerra.
But Republicans can’t derail Becerra on their own.
They only hold 50 Senate seats, so they'd need one Democrat to defect. The most likely is Sen. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.), who announced last week he won't support Neera Tanden to head the Office of Management and Budget. A spokeswoman for Manchin said yesterday that the senator is "undecided" on whether he'll vote to confirm Becerra.
So the pressure is on for Becerra to perform well at today's hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and again at tomorrow's hearing before the Senate Finance Committee.
Becerra plans to stress his work on health care in Congress and as attorney general.
According to Becerra's testimony, shared in advance with The Health 202, he will stress to lawmakers his work on health policy during the 24 years he served in the House of Representatives, including expanding the Children's Health Insurance Program, helping craft the Affordable Care Act and working to reform the Medicare program.
Becerra will also reference his actions as California attorney general to create a health-care rights and access unit, crack down on Medicare and Medicaid fraud and go after hospital consolidation.
"No one understands your states and communities better than you," the testimony says. "We may not always agree, but if I'm fortunate enough to be confirmed, I will always listen to you and keep an open mind ... find common cause ... and work with you to improve the health and dignity of the American people."
Republicans will argue Becerra isn’t qualified for the job.
"Mr. Becerra is the least-qualified nominee to serve as secretary in the history of HHS," a GOP Senate HELP committee aide told me yesterday.
This argument has two prongs: that Becerra isn't a medical professional and that he doesn't have experience managing an agency as massive as HHS.
Yet most health secretaries haven't possessed medical degrees — just three out of the 10 Senate-confirmed HHS secretaries had them in the last four decades. They include Tom Price (President Donald Trump), who was a doctor before joining Congress, and Louis Wade Sullivan (President George H.W. Bush) and Otis Bowen (President Ronald Reagan's second term).
Kaiser Health News's Julie Rovner:
And while four had been state governors, not all had managed massive agencies. President Bill Clinton's health secretary, Donna Shalala, was a university president. Sylvia Mathews Burwell, under President Barack Obama, had worked at the Gates Foundation and served as deputy director at OMB. Alex Azar, Trump's second health secretary, held a lower position at HHS before a foray into the pharmaceutical industry.
That hasn't stopped Cotton and more than 70 members of Congress (including 11 senators) from writing a letter to Biden, urging him to withdraw Becerra from consideration as HHS secretary. "Mr. Becerra's lack of healthcare experience, enthusiasm for replacing private health insurance with government-run Medicare-for-all, and embrace of radical policies on immigration, abortion and religious liberty, render him unfit for any position of public trust and especially for HHS secretary," the letter says.
However, Becerra has set records in going after GOP-led policies.
Democrats really disliked Price, who was a loud critic of the Affordable Care Act while in Congress. Not a single Democrat voted to confirm him back in 2017.
But Becerra, as attorney general, has been able to do much more than merely complain about the other party's policies; he's availed himself of the opportunity to fight them, as well as defending California laws that conservatives have argued – and the Supreme Court has sometimes agreed – violated freedom of religion and speech.
He defended a California law before the Supreme Court requiring antiabortion pregnancy centers to tell patients about the availability of abortion services. The court struck down that law in 2018. Becerra also sued over broadened exemptions to the ACA's requirement for employers to cover contraception; the court ultimately upheld those rules.
"Becerra has become a leader of the California resistance, the legal brain behind the state's fight against the president's policies on health care, the environment and most significantly, immigration," my colleague Samantha Schmidt wrote in 2018.
"If this is a battle between Trump's values and California's, as many believe it is, Becerra is a fitting warrior," Samantha wrote. "He is quintessentially Californian, representing an overwhelmingly Democratic state where27 percent of residents are foreign-born and where non-Hispanic whitesare just 38 percent of the population."
Becerra said at the time that he's loving every minute of the fight. "I feel almost liberated to try to express through our actions what California has meant to me and what it can mean to so many in the future," he told Samantha.
Committee Democrats will highlight Becerra’s experience legislating and leading.
They'll also urge a quick confirmation of Becerra amid the pandemic — although his confirmation hearings could probably have been held earlier had the Senate not spent time on a second trial to impeach Trump.
Health committee chairwoman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) will stress a lawsuit Becerra won against drug companies for blocking cheaper generics, his defense of the ACA against a challenge from GOP-led states and how he's gone after companies for flouting coronavirus safety rules.
"With this pandemic the clock is already ticking, and the reality is we are already way, way behind," Murray will say, in remarks provided to The Health 202. "We all want the pandemic to end — which means we all should want the Biden-Harris administration to succeed, and we should be getting qualified nominees like Attorney General Becerra on the job as quickly as possible."
Ahh, oof and ouchAHH: The White House honored the half million Americans who have died from covid-19.
"By the light of 500 candles as 'Amazing Grace' played outside the White House, President Biden bowed his head in a minute of reflection on the 500,000 American lives lost to the coronavirus, crossing himself after the music faded out," Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and Joel Achenbach report.
The president noted that the U.S. death toll from the pandemic has exceeded both world wars and the Vietnam War combined.
"The people we lost were extraordinary," Biden said in the White House's Cross Hall. "They span generations. Born in America, immigrated to America. But just like that, so many of them took their final breath alone in America."
Somber reminders will endure for the rest of the week, with flags flying at half-staff at all federal buildings, parks and other properties.
OOF: Vaccine makers are promising a major increase in deliveries over the next five weeks.
In a hearing today before a House Energy and Commerce Committee subcommittee, drug company executives plan to tell lawmakers that they project a major increase in vaccine deliveries that will result in 140 million more doses over the next five weeks. In their prepared testimony, they say they have solved manufacturing challenges and are in a position to overcome scarcity that has hampered the nation's fight against the coronavirus, Isaac Stanley-Becker and Christopher Rowland report.
"Because of the dire need to vaccinate more people, we have ramped up production of doses," wrote John Young, Pfizer's chief business officer.
"But achieving a surge on that scale remains daunting," Isaac and Christopher write. "Pfizer and Moderna, the companies with the only authorized vaccines so far, will need to increase their combined deliveries to date of 75 million doses to reach their promised target of 220 million shots by March 31."
"That's a goal of 28 million doses each week on average, far greater than their performance so far. The Biden administration said last week that doses allotted to states would grow from 11 million to 13.5 million per week, and it also directed 2 million doses to pharmacies, part of allocations that are expected to increase modestly again this week."
OUCH: Women of childbearing age have been surprisingly hesitant to get vaccinated.
Many women in their 20s and 30s have shown reluctance, stemming from disinformation spread on Facebook, Twitter and other social media, Ariana Eunjung Cha reports.
"With such women making up a large share of the health-care workforce, vaccine uptake at nursing homes and hospitals has been as low as 20 to 50 percent in some places — a far cry from the 70 to 85 percent population target that health officials say may be needed to stop the virus," Ariana writes.
"I'm worried, frankly," said Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. "There are stories out there on the Internet about how vaccination can lead to infertility. There's absolutely nothing to that. But when we look at people who are expressing hesitancy, in many instances those are women of childbearing age."
"The infertility myth is just one of many reasons women are hesitant, doctors and community organizers say, with others having more general concerns about a vaccine that has only recently been approved and the fact that early trials did not specifically look at pregnant or lactating women, leading to conflicting guidance from health authorities," Ariana writes.
Vaccines that have been modified to deal with variants can skip large clinical trials.
Guidance issued yesterday by the Food and Drug Administration says vaccine makers that want to modify their coronavirus vaccines to deal with variants can skip large clinical trials designed to test their shots' effectiveness, Laurie McGinley reports. Instead, the agency is looking for earlier-stage data that measures the immune responses of the individuals who receive the modified vaccine — and to see how they compare to the immune responses elicited by the original vaccine.
"The new advice to vaccine makers is part of a set of policies the FDA issued Monday to manufacturers of coronavirus vaccines, drugs and tests that want to alter or update their products to deal with variants," Laurie writes. "FDA officials said the goal was to spell out procedures under which companies can modify their products to outflank potential variants and quickly gain FDA clearance."
"We want the American public to know that we are using every tool in our toolbox to fight this pandemic, including pivoting as the virus adapts," Janet Woodcock, acting commissioner of the agency, said in a statement.
"There are no immediate plans to change vaccines," Laurie writes. "Studies have shown that the existing vaccines appear effective against the variant first detected in the United Kingdom, which may become dominant in the United States in March or April. Another variant, first detected in South Africa, appears to diminish the effectiveness of the vaccines, but scientists say they still may offer adequate protection."

Full text: The coronavirus didn't seem like a big deal to Craig Buescher at first. Still, he thought he was being careful.
He wore a mask in public — most of the time. He limited his circle of friends, but still saw six or eight people. He largely followed the rules, but admits that he occasionally stretched them.
Buescher was 69 and in good health. Surely, he thought, the virus wouldn't be that bad if he came down with it.
While he doesn't know how he ultimately contracted the virus, it was, in fact, quite bad. Nine days in the hospital, as he struggled to breathe, convinced him that not only did he need to be more careful to avoid the virus, but also that he should persuade others to do the same.
"I couldn't walk across the room without stopping," said Buescher, of South Bend, Neb. "That proved to be the thing that made a believer out of me."
For all those like Buescher, who has become more cautious since the pandemic was declared in March, millions of others continue to resist recommended precautions or have stopped following public health guidance because of pandemic fatigue. Officials and health experts are sounding the alarm about the virus's dangerous surge — the United States is logging more than 160,000 new infections per day on average — while many desperately try to determine how to persuade people to change their behavior.
To be sure, plenty of Americans are heeding officials' advice to limit their time in public places, avoid small gatherings and stay away from large crowds. But a Gallup poll conducted in September found that the numbers of people who report doing each of those things have been trending downward and are at their lowest levels since March: 70 percent said they had avoided large crowds in the past week, 53 percent had stayed away from public places and 45 percent had forgone small gatherings.
Most people who are ignoring public health recommendations probably either don't perceive themselves as at-risk for severe consequences of the coronavirus or don't believe the suggested behaviors will protect them, experts say.
Social norms also have a big impact on decision-making. In places where most people are following the guidelines, others are likely to follow. Because the United States did not create uniform norms early in the pandemic, wearing masks and maintaining distance are still unpopular in some places.
Changing those norms by highlighting the many people who are following the rules could be key to persuading others to alter their behavior, research shows.
"Even when we know what we SHOULD be doing, if we find out that other people aren't doing it, we probably won't do it," Vanessa Bohns, who teaches organizational behavior at Cornell University, wrote in an email. "Interestingly, lots of persuasive messaging undermines itself by saying, 'You should do this,' and then immediately afterwards saying, 'But most people aren't doing this.'"
Meeting the virus face-to-face
Despite attempts to shift social norms, experts say the most effective factor in shifting people's behavior may still be personal encounters with the dangers of the virus. While many Americans still flout public health measures after having close experiences with the pathogen, psychologists are hopeful that there's a tipping point at which the amount of people who act more cautiously after a personal experience will affect the pandemic's trajectory.
For Buescher, it took getting sick for him to buckle down on mask-wearing and social distancing. His brush with covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, came in September, when he noticed that his legs were weak and he felt tired all the time. He said his doctor prescribed him medication and urged him to go to an emergency room if his blood-oxygen level dipped below 90 percent.
Soon it did, Buescher said, and his wife drove him to the hospital. After eight days of supplemental oxygen, his daughter told him that his doctors warned her at one point that they would have to put him on a ventilator if his breathing didn't improve.
The experience left Buescher a changed man — one who keeps two or three masks in each of the family's cars so they're always prepared, and he has tightened his social circle to one other couple. He and his wife celebrated Thanksgiving with their four adult children over Zoom, and they're rethinking their Christmas plans.
"There'll be other Christmases," Buescher said, "unless we're not responsible."
Buescher has also become an evangelist for coronavirus-conscious decision-making. He makes sure to wear a mask when he goes into a business, even though he's now unlikely to be infectious, because he wants to set a good example. He's been sharing his covid-19 experience with others through Facebook posts. And he recently spoke at one of Gov. Pete Ricketts's news conferences to urge fellow Nebraskans to be cautious.
"Is this something we're going to do every year?" Buescher said at the news conference, of his family's plan to celebrate Thanksgiving virtually. "No, we've got to do it this year so that we have the capabilities of getting back on track next year."
As word spread in his small town that the virus hit him hard, Buescher said others have told him that hearing about his experience changed their own behavior. One of those friends was Chuck Baum, who said he felt at the onset of the pandemic like the constant crush of coronavirus news might be just a lot of crying wolf.
It wasn't that Baum and his wife weren't taking any precautions. He got sent home from his job in the livestock industry. They paused their habit of eating at a restaurant every other week. Neither of them went to big weddings or funerals anymore.
But the virus seemed to be on every TV station, all the time. Who knew how bad it really was?
"At some point in time, you tune the news media out," said Baum, of Denton, Neb. "Until you start knowing people that are dying, then it becomes real."
Buescher wasn't the only person who helped make the virus feel more real to Baum. First it was a friend in his 60s, who died in March. Then his college roommate's father succumbed to the virus. In October, one of his customers died two days after Baum found out the man was sick.
The biggest change Baum said he has made since seeing friends die of the virus is no longer going inside his 92-year-old mother's house. He has visited her twice in the past month, but now he opens the kitchen door and the screen door and talks to her from outside.
That kind of change is unsurprising to Donald Edmondson, who leads the Science of Behavior Change, a network supported by the National Institutes of Health that uses experimental medicine to study behavior change. As more members of a community become seriously ill and die of covid-19, Edmondson said, the norms in that area are likely to eventually change.
"There has to be a point at which there's a feedback loop that begins to shift behaviors," he said.
Choosing the right messenger
Talking to people about the dangers of the virus can also influence people's behavior, but only if the message is coming from someone they trust, experts say. A breakdown of faith in institutions has left many skeptical of anything they're told by government officials, academics or journalists.
Some people are so mired in disinformation that experts believe it would be hard to persuade them to change their behaviors. Nearly 1 in 5 U.S. adults believes the coronavirus is less lethal than the seasonal flu, and 41 percent think the official coronavirus death toll has been overstated, according to a Gallup/Knight Foundation poll conducted in September.
"The best bang for your buck is going to be those people who are on the fence who are just tired," said Jay Van Bavel, an associate professor of psychology at New York University. "You can probably get through to more of them than people who are just very far gone."
For those who consume mostly accurate information, the key is for people to directly encourage their family members and friends to make safe choices. Van Bavel pointed as an example to social media campaigns such as the "Ice Bucket Challenge," which made waves online in 2014 and raised millions of dollars for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) research.
It's important for public health officials to communicate risk-mitigation measures to people who will listen, Van Bavel said, but it's equally crucial that those people share them with their loved ones who aren't inclined to believe authority figures. People are more inclined to agree to requests from people they like, research shows.
For those who have been convinced by arguments that wearing masks or maintaining social distance are an assault on freedom, Van Bavel said he would redefine freedom as the ability to move through society more freely if everyone takes precautions such as wearing masks. He said people are sensitive to the idea that they are losing something, so he would also suggest that the real risk is not losing freedom.
"I would frame it as, the real risk of loss is not missing a holiday with the family," Van Bavel said. "It's missing the family — having them die or have permanent lung damage or brain damage or psychiatric problems."
With access to coronavirus vaccines on the horizon, experts say there's another strategy for persuading people to be cautious: reminding them that the pandemic's end is in sight and they wouldn't want to contract the virus soon before they could have been inoculated.
Van Bavel compared the situation to the "marshmallow test," a well-known psychological experiment in which a child could either eat a marshmallow right away or stay unaccompanied with it in the room for up to 20 minutes and then receive two marshmallows as a reward for her patience.
"We're now in a marshmallow test as a society," Van Bavel said. "We need to tell people that you can have those two marshmallows, you can have lots of gatherings with family, lots of trips, lots of economic activities, if you can just hold off for a few minutes and not eat the marshmallow right now."

The people
HOW DO YOU SOLVE A PROBLEM LIKE MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE?: Democrats want the Georgia lawmaker — who has spread dangerous conspiracy theories, made racist remarks and urged the execution of Democratic lawmakers — to resign. Republicans, however, plan on sitting down to have a stern chat with her.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) confirmed to Power Up he is sitting down next weekwith Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) to discuss the comments — including liking a Facebook post calling for executing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the false "Frazzledrip" conspiracy theory.
But verbal scolds aren't likely to solve a much larger issue for Republicans following Donald Trump's presidency: the rampant disinformation spreading like wildfire among a significant portion of their base. Many of the people who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 erroneously believe Trump won the election after massive fraud, a conspiracy theory the former president and top allies propagated.
"The GOP has spent the last year and more between accepting and disavowing this part of their base … they need to do some soul searching and decide if it's politically more expedient for them to cater to that base and accept the danger and risk Greene poses to everyone or will they speak out against her?" Emily Dreyfuss, a senior editor and fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center, said.
Deplatforming has proven to be an important first step in cutting off some of the conspiracy theorists' oxygen. But disinformation experts believe simply shutting down some of the top peddlers of extremist ideologies and disinformation campaigns isn't enough to resolve a pervasive problem that's penetrated the American political system.
Just yesterday, the Department of Homeland Security issued a warning to "alert the public about the growing threat of 'ideologically-motivated violent extremists' agitated about President Biden's inauguration and 'perceived grievances fueled by false narratives,'" our colleague Nick Miroff reports. 
They recommend a holistic government approach to fight the disinformation pandemic that's touched everything from the electoral system to climate change to the coronavirus.
"I'm not putting the onus on [the Biden administration] for the other political party that's actively welcomed conspiracy theorists and extremists into their fold and leadership. But the Biden administration needs to have clear and coherent policies on this issue," Graham Brookie, the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab director and managing editor, told Power Up.
"Disinformation and the structures that accelerate disinformation create catalytic vulnerabilities that make every discrete issue it touches — from climate change to foreign policy — much harder to deal with and so having a comprehensive strategy around this set of issues is foundational to the strength of our democracy," Brookie added.
The Biden administration has already announced plans to combat disinformation on specific issues and signaled its commitment to restoring public trust in facts and truth. But Dreyfuss and Brookie are among those advocating for a more robust effort.
For example, outlined in Biden's coronavirus plan released last week are efforts to reestablish trust with the American public through "world-class public education campaigns — covering topics like masking, testing, vaccinations and vaccine hesitancy — designed with diversity and inclusivity in mind, including communications in multiple languages, to maximize reach and effectiveness," according to the 200-page document.
"The campaigns will be coordinated, across national, state, and local levels, and engage with the private and public sector. They will be anchored by science and fact-based public health guidance. The Administration will work to counter misinformation and disinformation by ensuring that Americans are obtaining science-based information," the plan says.
Democratic lawmakers urged Biden in December to appoint disinformation expert Joan Donovan, the research director at Harvard Shorenstein Center, to his coronavirus task force.
"Understanding and addressing misinformation — and the wider phenomena of declining public trust in institutions, political polarization, networked social movements, and online information environments that create fertile grounds for the spread of falsehoods — is a critical part of our nation's public health response," lawmakers wrote in a letter to Biden signed by Sens. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and others.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden has tasked the director of national intelligence, along with DHS and the FBI, to compile a comprehensive threat assessment on violent domestic extremism. The report is likely to home in on the role disinformation has played in radicalizing domestic extremists.
"The White House will also have its National Security Council review policy to determine whether the government can better share information or take other steps to mitigate the threat. She said the review would be overseen by Joshua Geltzer, a former senior director for counterterrorism, along with current officials. 'Clearly, more needs to be done,' Psaki said," according to our colleagues Matt Zapotosky and Shane Harris. 
Other options: The Jan. 6 siege also renewed calls to reform section 230, which provides online platforms immunity from what their users post. Reps. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) and Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) co-sponsored legislation last year, "which takes away immunity protections from platforms that amplify certain types of hateful or extremist content, is also ready to take action on Section 230 reform," Recode's Sara Morrison reports. 
"Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and many smaller platforms gave violent rioters a platform to organize and share dangerous misinformation, while allowing President Trump to inspire and encourage insurrection and sedition against our republic," Eshoo told Morrison. "These companies' reckless actions and inactions played a colossal role in Wednesday's attack on our nation's Capitol that must be addressed."
On the Hill
RUSH TO JUDGMENT: "Bracing for the prospect of a likely acquittal, Senate Democrats are eyeing a rapid-fire impeachment trial for Trump, while also contemplating alternatives such as censure that could attract more support from Republicans," Mike DeBonis and Paul Kane report. 
Rethinking the plan to impeach "reflects a growing desire among most Democrats to move forward with Biden's governing agenda in light of a test vote Tuesday that saw all but five Republican senators back Trump in a constitutional challenge to proceeding with the trial."
A minor majority: "Here's how fragile Democrats' Senate majority is: The brief Tuesday hospitalization of Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) prompted nearly everyone in the Capitol to research Vermont's Senate vacancy laws, just in case," Politico's Burgess Everett reports.
"Just the possibility of Leahy missing a day of work sent a jolt through an evenly divided Senate, which Democrats control with just Vice President Harris's tie breaking vote."
Full-steam ahead:
The Senate Commerce Committee approved the nomination of Pete Buttigieg as transportation secretary, and held confirmation hearings for Jennifer Granholm to serve as energy secretary; Linda Thomas-Greenfield to be ambassador to the United Nations and Denis McDonough, Biden's nominee for veterans affairs secretary.
Still to come:
Confirmation hearings for Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), Biden's nominee to be secretary of housing and urban development, before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee
Cecilia Rouse, nominee to be chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, before the same panel
Outside the Beltway
WALL STREET CAN'T STOP WON'T STOP GAME STOP: Wall Street suffered its sharpest daily decline since October "as investors awaited a number of earnings reports from large technology companies and as the Federal Reserve issued a glum assessment of the economy," Eshe Nelson of the New York Times reports.
"The Dow fell nearly 634 points, or 2.1 percent. The S&P 500 dropped nearly 99 points, or 2.6 percent, while the Nasdaq lost about 355 points, or 2.6 percent," David J. Lynch, Hamza Shaban, Hannah Denham and Tory Newmyer report.
The dip also came amid growing anxiety over the rollout of coronavirus vaccines as new variants spread across the globe, and as "traders were captivated by the frenzied trading in GameStop and other heavily shorted stocks," The Wall Street Journal's Will Horner and Paul Vigna report.
The GameStop must go on: "Shares of video game retailer GameStop and movie theater giant AMC Entertainment soared to astronomical levels yesterday as an apparent swarm of ordinary investors, spurred on by a Reddit message board, took on big Wall Street funds that had bet the stock prices would fall," my colleagues report. 
"GameStop shares more than doubled, to $347.51, and have soared more than 400 percent this week. AMC, beleaguered by the coronavirus pandemic and stay-at-home measures, quadrupled to $19 a share."
"The price surges were so dramatic that trading for both companies was temporarily halted by the stock exchanges to temper volatility. But once trading resumed, prices took off again."
Key quote: "I didn't realize it was this cult like," short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research, who has become a particular target of some investors on social media told the Wall Street Journal. "It's just a get-rich-quick scheme."
Meanwhile, Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell said the economic outlook "remains highly uncertain," and that "getting Americans vaccinated is the most important thing to help the economy," Erica Werner and Rachel Siegel report. 
At the White House
CORONAVIRUS CONTINUES TO RAVAGE THE U.S.: "Biden's coronavirus czar said that the United States was woefully behind other nations in tracking potentially dangerous variants of the virus," The Times's Sheryl Gay Stolberg reports. 
Key quote: "We are 43rd in the world in genomic sequencing — totally unacceptable," said Jeffrey D. Zients, Biden's coordinator of the federal vaccine response.
Help is on the way, eventually: While promising to ramp up vaccine distribution, the Biden administration "acknowledged that most Americans will need to wait months to get vaccinated," Amy Goldstein and Lena H. Sun report.
"Administration advisers said that the mass vaccination campaign is constrained by both the vaccine supply and the ability to administer shots."
"The White House also continued for a second day to step back from a statement Biden made in which he appeared to raise his goal for the pace of vaccinations from 1 million doses per day his first 100 days in office to 1.5 million a day."
"Biden also plans to sign an executive order this afternoon to reopen the Affordable Care Act's federal insurance marketplace for three months to give Americans who need coverage during the coronavirus pandemic a special chance to buy health plans," Goldstein reports. 
But as the Biden administration pledges to push for equity in all aspects o policy, including its pandemic response, many states are falling down on the job.
"Most states are not publicly reporting racial data on people receiving coronavirus vaccines, despite disproportionate covid-19 death rates for Black and Hispanic people," Lola Fadulu and Dan Keating report.
"Seven weeks after the first shots were administered, just 20 states include race and ethnicity data on their vaccine dashboards, even though it is required by the federal government."
The investigations
Caught red-handed at the 'Bank of BARDA': "Federal officials repeatedly raided a fund earmarked for biomedical research in the years leading up to the covid-19 pandemic, spending millions of dollars on unrelated salaries, administrative expenses and even the cost of removing office furniture, according to the findings of an investigation into a whistleblower complaint," Dan Diamond and Lisa Rein report.
The investigation "centered on hundreds of millions of dollars intended for the development of vaccines, drugs and therapies by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority or BARDA, an arm of the federal health department."
Split personalities: "Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys extremist group, has a past as an informer for federal and local law enforcement, repeatedly working undercover for investigators after he was arrested in 2012," Reuters reports.
Tarrio, who is under intense scrutiny after the Jan. 6 Capitol attacks, denied working undercover or cooperating in any cases, telling Reuters, "I don't know any of this."
But "in a screed posted online later in the day, Tarrio criticized the government and the media for disclosing his past activities and argued that his cooperation was done with the full knowledge and participation of his co-defendants," Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky report.
Proud Boys and fallen officers: Tarrio's past surfaced into public view as "the toll of deaths and injuries for the police officers involved in defending the U.S. Capitol during the attack by a pro-Trump mob has risen to more than 140," Tom Jackman reports.
Capitol Police Officer Brian D. Sicknick died after trying to defend the Capitol from rioters.
One Capitol Police officer and one D.C. police officer have died by suicide since the attack.
"At least 81 Capitol Police officers were assaulted during the siege of the Capitol," and "65 officers from the D.C. police also suffered injuries including several concussions from head blows from various objects, including metal poles ripped from inauguration-related scaffolding."
The making of a mob: "Three self-styled militia members charged in the Jan. 6 breach of the U.S. Capitol began soliciting recruits for potential violence within days of the 2020 presidential election, later training in Ohio and North Carolina and organizing travel to Washington with a busload of comrades and a truck of weapons, U.S. authorities alleged Wednesday," Spencer S. Hsu, Rachel Weiner and Tom Jackman report.
"A four-count indictment returned in D.C. laid out fresh details and allegations against Jessica Marie Watkins, 38, and Donovan Ray Crowl, 50 — both of Woodstock, Ohio — and Thomas E. Caldwell, 66, of Berryville, Va.
The three, all U.S. military veterans, are accused of conspiring to obstruct Congress and other counts, punishable by up to 20 years in prison."

Full text: with Brent D. Griffiths
Good Tuesday morning. It's Election Day in America (and the 2020 cycle is almost, finally over). We're also excited to welcome Olivier Knox to the Post's newsletter team -- he'll be taking over as anchor of The Daily 202 at the end of January ( sign up here). Thanks for waking up with us. See ya when we've got some results from Georgia.
The campaign
'BAD NIGHT' IN GEORGIA FOR GOP?: National and Georgia Republicans are growing increasingly frustrated with President Trump's baseless tirades against Georgia's presidential election results, fearing the president's attacks may cost them control of the Senate.
They're concerned Trump's relentless and baseless broadsides on the voting system — and tomorrow's electoral college challenge further dividing GOPers — will deter Republicans from trusting the system enough to vote in today's two Georgia Senate runoffs.
Dueling appearances: Trump didn't help matters by holding a rally last night in Georgia in which he repeated his assertions he won the state, and said he hopes Vice President Pence will somehow aid the electoral college challenge when he presides over it. Biden also campaigned yesterday in the Peach State.
Control of the Senate in Washington depends on the Georgia outcome.
"Trump's been generally unhelpful throughout this whole process," a GOP Senate aide told Power Up. "He's managed to split the party at every turn since November and that division could result in lower turnout on our side," the aide added, referring to Trump's last-minute demand for $2,000 stimulus checks followed by his veto of a $740 billion defense bill.
"Republicans should be prepared for a bad night," the aide added.
"Without the Trump factor — and all the [expletive] he's done, then we'd probably win by three or five points," a GOP strategist working on the runoff races in Georgia told us. "With the Trump factor, if we lose by one or two points, I won't be shocked."
"Not only is Trump depressing turnout on the right but he's reminding independent voters, 'Crap, maybe we do need Democrats in the Senate as Republicans are going along with these absurd efforts to find 11,780 votes,'" the GOP strategist added, referring to Trump's urging of Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) during a weekend phone call.
Turnout means what?: Early reports from Georgia show robust early voting and absentee turnout, which favored Democrats in the presidential race where Georgia went blue for the first time since 1992. Public and private polling, according to GOP sources, has shown tight races between Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue and their Democratic challengers, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.
Historians and political scientists predict Tuesday's double-barreled runoff election is unlikely to result in a split outcome. "The last time there was a split decision in one of these 'double-barrel' Senate elections was 1966," according to FiveThirtyEight's Nathaniel Rakich.
The big questions remain just how much Trump's attacks on the state's presidential results – including unfounded charges of voting machine fraud – will depress GOP turnout; and if Georgia really has gone blue.
"Will it ultimately cause some Republicans to sit out the election or will it give moderate Republicans some pause about Perdue and Loeffler, who are basically taking Trump's side with this?" Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University told Power Up.
"We can look at what happened in November and say that was just a rejection of Trump … but if Democrats win these two Senate seats, the blue tsunami has hit," Charles Bullock, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia, told us.
Trump's behavior certainly isn't hurting Democrats: Abramowitz noted over 110,000 voters who did not cast ballots in November's general election voted early or absentee in the Georgia runoffs so far — a number that skews toward Democrats.
Split screen: Biden returned to Atlanta in his closing pitch for a Senate majority that could give Democrats a narrow trifecta of power as he begins his administration, our colleagues write.
"The power is literally in your hands," Biden told the crowd. "By electing Jon and the reverend, you can break the gridlock that has gripped Washington."
On the road: Trump made a final lap through Dalton, Georgia on Monday evening in a last-ditch attempt to inspire voters who did not vote early to turn out on Election Day and erase Democrats's early voting advantage.
While Trump pleaded with the crowd to turn out for Loeffler and Perdue, he spent a majority of the rally veering off-script, propagating disinformation and false claims of voter fraud. The first words Trump uttered: "There's no way we lost Georgia. That was a rigged election." The outgoing president also lobbed not-so-veiled threats toward fellow Republicans for not parroting his unsubstantiated claims.
"Trump went on to bash [Georgia's Gov. Brian] Kemp and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, claim they were not real Republicans, and promise to campaign against both men when they stand for reelection in 2022," our colleagues Philip Rucker, Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Seung Min Kim report. 
"The president also falsely said he had won reelection 'in a landslide' and suggested that he expects Vice President Pence to make it so when he fulfills his constitutional duty to preside over Wednesday's joint session of Congress, even though the vice president does not have the power to overturn the results."
"I hope Mike Pence comes through for us, I have to tell you," Trump told the applauding Georgia crowd. "Of course, if he doesn't come through, I won't like him quite as much."
Trump obliquely acknowledged displeasure from Republicans who condemned his hour-long conversation with Raffensperger, including Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.).
"If they win, I'll get no credit. And if they lose, they're gonna blame Trump, these people," he told the crowd.
Earlier in the day, Gabriel Sterling, a GOP official in Raffensperger's office, urged Georgians to turn out and vote on Tuesday, despite Trump's unhelpful comments.
"Given the nature of the President's statements and people with aligned with him … we are specifically asking you and telling you, please turn out and vote tomorrow," Georgia's voting systems manager told reporters during a news conference. "The secretary wants me to make clear that everybody's vote is going to count and everybody's vote did count," Sterling said. 
Georgia election officials, meanwhile, are preparing for "the biggest runoff we've ever seen," Joe Sorenson, the communications director of the Gwinnett County government, told our colleague Reis Thebault. 
"Officials in Fulton, Gwinnett and DeKalb counties — three of the four largest in the state — told The Washington Post that more than 900,000 people in their counties have voted early, between absentee ballots and in-person locations. They said they hope to finish counting all but the last of the mailed ballots by late Tuesday," according to Reis.
Trump's rhetoric is bound to have longer lasting consequences than today's result. If his party loses both races in a previously deep red state and control of the Senate, it will "not be a quick and painless process" to uniting a fractured Republican Party in a post-Trump world, a GOP source working on the runoffs told us.
The biggest challenge for the Republican Party will be bridging "the information crisis," the source told us. "[Trump] was right about 1 thing: it's not social media, its Trump media. There's an ecosystem out there peddling crack."
On the Hill
WHERE SENATORS STAND: After the publication of Trump's call to Raffensberger, Georgia's Loeffler is the only senator to have added her name to efforts to oppose certifying Biden's victory in tomorrow's joint session of Congress, per our colleagues' tracker.
About Wednesday: The New York Times's Maggie Haberman and Annie Karni report that Trump has "directly pressed Mr. Pence to find an alternative to certifying Mr. Biden's win, such as preventing him from having 270 electoral votes and letting the election be thrown to the House to decide."
"Members of the vice president's circle expect that Mr. Pence will follow the rules while on the Senate floor and play his ceremonial role as scripted, aides said. But after that, he will have to compensate by showing his fealty to Mr. Trump."
"A tentative final foreign trip by Mr. Pence to visit Israel, Bahrain and Belgium was scrapped, while more events to talk up Mr. Trump's legacy at home are being considered, according to a person familiar with the plans. Aides would not say whether Mr. Pence would attend Mr. Biden's inauguration."
Shot: The president himself is "trying to mobilize a show of strength that could intimidate lawmakers who certify the result, exhorting his supporters to travel to Washington for mass protests Wednesday. He is planning to speak to the crowd on the Ellipse around midday Wednesday, two officials familiar with the planning said," according to our colleagues. 
Chaser: "Still, Trump is not entirely blind to reality. He has asked several advisers in recent weeks for advice on what he should do instead of attending President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, according to two people who have spoken to him."
Here is where thing stand:
The people
D.C. MOBILIZES NATIONAL GUARD: "The District has mobilized the National Guard and will have every city police officer on duty [today] and Wednesday to handle protests of the November presidential election, which Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said may include people looking to instigate violence," Julie Zauzmer, Marissa J. Lang and Dan Lamothe report.
Bowser is asking residents to avoid downtown area today and tomorrow: Trump is encouraging his supporters to attend rallies and may make an appearance during a demonstration at the Ellipse, just outside of the White House. The rally is timed to occur just as a joint session of Congress occurs.
The Pentagon raised questions about the size and scope of the guard's deployment: The 300 members of the District's National Guard will be unarmed and will help enforce street closures and other crowd management. "The military also has not approved the use of its helicopters, which were deployed over protesters in June in an apparent show of force, prompting a military investigation whose results still have not been released."
A Proud Boys leader was arrested in connection with a previous demonstration: "Enrique Tarrio, was arrested by D.C. police on a warrant charging him with burning a Black Lives Matter banner taken from a historic Black church during a demonstration last month, officials said," Peter Hermann and Martin Weil report.
The Proud Boys, a male-chauvinist organization with ties to white nationalism, is planning to participate in rallies supporting Trump's efforts to overturn the election.
Tarrio was taken into custody as he entered the city: "Police said he also was charged with two felony counts of possession of high-capacity ammunition feeding devices, which is a legal term for a magazine that allows guns to hold additional bullets. The devices were found during the arrest, police said."
In the agencies
FDA STICKS BY VACCINE REGIMEN: "The U.S. government's top infectious-disease doctor, a leading drug regulator and the Health and Human Services secretary are dismissing suggestions that the second shot of authorized coronavirus vaccines could be delayed to make more doses available faster to more people," Carolyn Y. Johnson reports.
How we got here: "In recent days, some public health experts have debated whether it is worth taking a scientific gamble by altering the two-dose regimen that proved highly effective in trials to maximize the number of people partially protected with at least one shot as the pandemic surges."
Key quote: The Food and Drug Administration said it would be "premature" and "not rooted solidly in the available evidence" to change the way the two authorized vaccines are administered.
Meanwhile, another grim record: "More than 128,000 people across the United States are currently hospitalized with covid-19 on Monday, according to data tracked by The Washington Post. That number is a record and represents an increase of 2,800 patients in a single day," Antonia Noori Farzan reports.
Global power
BRITAIN LOCKS DOWN: " Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered a third national lockdown for England amid a surging coronavirus outbreak driven by a U.K. variant that appears to be more contagious and may have greater implications for children," Karla Adam, Jennifer Hassan and Ben Guarino report from London.
Johnson said the new variant is 50 to 70 percent more transmissible: "The government had been facing growing calls to impose further restrictions as coronavirus cases continue to skyrocket. On Monday, Britain recorded 58,784 new daily cases, the highest figure recorded here during the pandemic."
What it means: "Everyone in England will be asked to stay at home except in special circumstances. Schools and universities will close for in-class learning with immediate effect."
The variant is so new that we're still learning about it: "It has spread to dozens of countries and has been detected in four U.S. states, may have had a disproportionate effect on people under 20 in Britain, according to a new report that has not gone through scientific peer-review."
More details on the study: "When the study authors evaluated patients by age, they found a slightly higher proportion of variant vs. non-variant cases in people younger than 20. The researchers' observations cannot explain why. The difference they detected may have been circumstantial."
In the media
EPA finalizes rule to limit science behind public health safeguards: "EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the rule 'will prioritize transparency' … Many of the nation's leading researchers and academic organizations, however, argue that the criteria will actually restrict the EPA from using some of the most consequential research on human subjects because it often includes confidential medical records and other proprietary data that cannot be released due to privacy concerns," Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis report.
A beautiful tribute to a life lost too soon:

Full text: As covid-19 cases surge and lockdowns, distancing and mask use continue, the early stages of distribution of two highly effective vaccines — now authorized for emergency use — are a glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel.
But this is just the very beginning of what will be another long journey, in many ways even more complex than the age-old disease control measures that we have all been learning to navigate over the past year.
We have barely begun the real task of coronavirus vaccine rollout. 2021 will be one of the most critical years of our collective lives. Will we be able to slow the swell of cases? Are we prepared for the challenges ahead and ready to manage the inevitable risks?
It is good news that Congress included $28 billion to purchase and deliver vaccines to Americans in the nearly $900 billion stimulus bill, but funding alone will not change the minds and emotions of the public.
The first year of the pandemic was riddled with misinformation and disinformation, and the vaccines will bring more rumors and falsehoods. As hundreds of millions of people around the world get immunized, it's inevitable that some will experience adverse reactions — and some may still get covid-19. Public health officials need to prepare now for how to answer good-faith questions and fend off deliberate lies.
Even with the two vaccines approved and others in the pipeline, the reality is that we may not have enough for everyone who wants them — or at least not for a while. It will be important to share as much information as possible up front, so the people who want the vaccine will know when and where they can get one. Local communities will want to establish vaccine information centers or online resources where updated information is made available and questions can be answered. It is totally reasonable that people will have questions and concerns about these new vaccines. If officials are dismissive of the concerns or fail to give honest answers about what we know — as well as what we don't know — then we risk losing public trust not only in the vaccines, but in the system.
Once people do get their first vaccine, the next challenge will be to ensure they come back for the second dose for those vaccines which require it, as both the Pfizer and Moderna products do. For some people, the challenge may not be hesitancy, but more practical concerns: Maybe they can't take more time off from work to get the second dose, or they didn't feel well after the first dose. Even the more common but temporary mild headaches and fatigue that trial participants reported could make people hesitate to go back for another dose, leaving them with only partial protection.
Another challenge ahead will be convincing people to continue to wear masks and keep distance even after they are vaccinated. What is the point of vaccinating if you still need to keep wearing mask? Well, for one thing, the vaccine does not work immediately. It takes awhile for the first dose's protection to kick in, and then you still need to get your second dose to be fully immunized. Even then, in principle, we need to get enough people vaccinated for wider protection before shedding other precautions. But the reality is that while we know that these vaccines can prevent serious disease and death, we won't yet know whether they prevent transmission to others until enough people get vaccinated.
As additional vaccines wrap up their clinical trials and win approval, new issues will come up. Who decides who gets which vaccines? What will be the criteria? Some of the answers will come down to logistical requirements — the vaccines that need less-extreme refrigeration than the mRNA vaccines Pfizer and Moderna make may be prioritized for poorer countries with less cold-storage capacity. But the differences across the various vaccines, including different numbers of doses needed and varying levels of effectiveness, will need clear and accessible communication starting now, not waiting until there is a confusing mix of vaccines becoming available. We are already in a time of hyper-uncertainty — fertile ground for rumors to evolve and spread. Adding these multiple vaccines without a coherent story as to who gets what and why will only exacerbate the already patchwork landscape of information, leaving the public to create their own interpretation or misinterpretation.
Another potential challenge of having multiple coronavirus vaccines is that individuals may start with one vaccine and want to switch to another, thinking it may have less-severe side effects or be more effective. Careful monitoring of who is taking which vaccines will be especially important for longer term safety monitoring.
With so many people getting vaccinated, there will be adverse events. One type will be coincidental events that seem to be related to the vaccine because they happen around the same time as people get the injection, but that aren't actually caused by the vaccine. In this case, older populations are being prioritized, along with health-care workers. This is an age group that normally has a higher frequency of illness and death, so sooner or later, someone will get sick or die soon after vaccination. Even if it's completely unrelated, there's a danger that people will think it was caused by the vaccine. On the other hand, there may also be adverse events that are actually found to be caused by the vaccine — such as the small number of people who experienced a severe adverse reaction called anaphylaxis following vaccination, due to underlying allergies specific to ingredients in the vaccine. Those with other underlying allergies can still take the vaccine.
Officials will have to look into any such episodes carefully and quickly so that the public can be either reassured that the adverse events were coincidental or alerted to underlying conditions in which the vaccine is not recommended.
We have already seen a proliferation of misinformation and disinformation surrounding the SARS-CoV-2 virus, its origins and the various measures to contain its spread, including vaccination. Some of this misinformation is due to uncertainties, even in the scientific community, surrounding the new virus as well as the treatments and vaccines that are under development or newly approved. People are struggling to make sense of the state of things, relying on news headlines, news releases, heard and socially shared news — and they sometimes wind up spreading misinformation inadvertently.
But there are also those who are purposely spreading harmful, incorrect information, trying to disrupt and seed doubts to undermine public confidence. While fact-checking and debunking rumors is helpful, it is not sustainable. This is a deeper threat, which needs a resilient public armed not only with positive, clear information, but a clear sense of where this is all headed — a path, a direction for a better 2021 within which we situate the story of how society and science can come together around a vaccine that changed the world.
It could be an extraordinary moment. If we get it right.

Full text: Election-related falsehoods have subsided, but misleading claims about the coronavirus vaccines are surging -- often spread by the same people.
Sidney Powell, a lawyer who was part of President Trump's legal team, spread a conspiracy theory last month about election fraud. For days, she claimed that she would "release the Kraken" by showing voluminous evidence that Mr. Trump had won the election by a landslide.
But after her assertions were widely derided and failed to gain legal traction, Ms. Powell started talking about a new topic. On Dec. 4, she posted a link on Twitter with misinformation that said that the population would be split into the vaccinated and the unvaccinated and that "big government" could surveil those who were unvaccinated.
"NO WAY #America," Ms. Powell wrote in the tweet, which collected 22,600 shares and 51,000 likes. "This is more authoritarian communist control imported straight from #China." She then tagged Mr. Trump and the former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn -- both of whom she had represented -- and other prominent right-wing figures to highlight the post.
Ms. Powell's changing tune was part of a broader shift in online misinformation. As Mr. Trump's challenges to the election's results have been knocked down and the Electoral College has affirmed President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s win, voter fraud misinformation has subsided. Instead, peddlers of online falsehoods are ramping up lies about the Covid-19 vaccines, which were administered to Americans for the first time this week.
Apart from Ms. Powell, others who have spread political misinformation such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican of Georgia, as well as far-right websites like ZeroHedge, have begun pushing false vaccine narratives, researchers said. Their efforts have been amplified by a robust network of anti-vaccination activists like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on platforms including Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.
Among their misleading notions is the idea that the vaccines are delivered with a microchip or bar code to keep track of people, as well as a lie that the vaccines will hurt everyone's health (the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been proved to be more than 94 percent effective in trials, with minimal side effects). Falsehoods about Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist who supports vaccines, have also increased, with rumors that he is responsible for the coronavirus and that he stands to profit from a vaccine, according to data from media insights company Zignal Labs.
The shift shows how political misinformation purveyors are hopping from topic to topic to maintain attention and influence, said Melissa Ryan, chief executive of Card Strategies, a consulting firm that researches disinformation.
It is "an easy pivot," she said. "Disinformation about vaccines and the pandemic have long been staples of the pro-Trump disinformation playbook."
The change has been particularly evident over the last six weeks. Election misinformation peaked on Nov. 4 at 375,000 mentions across cable television, social media, print and online news outlets, according to an analysis by Zignal. By Dec. 3, that had fallen to 60,000 mentions. But coronavirus misinformation steadily increased over that period, rising to 46,100 mentions on Dec. 3, from 17,900 mentions on Nov. 8.
NewsGuard, a start-up that fights false stories, said that of the 145 websites in its Election Misinformation Tracking Center, a database of sites that publish false election information, 60 percent of them have also published misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic. That includes right-wing outlets such as Breitbart, Newsmax and One America News Network, which distributed inaccurate articles about the election and are now also running misleading articles about the vaccines.
John Gregory, the deputy health editor for NewsGuard, said the shift was not to be taken lightly because false information about vaccines leads to real-world harm. In Britain in the early 2000s, he said, a baseless link between the measles vaccine and autism spooked people into not taking that vaccine. That led to deaths and serious permanent injuries, he said.
"Misinformation creates fear and uncertainty around the vaccine and can reduce the number of people willing to take it," said Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington evolutionary biologist who has been tracking the pandemic.
Dr. Shira Doron, an epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center, said the consequences of people not taking the Covid-19 vaccines because of misinformation would be catastrophic. The vaccines are "the key piece to ending the pandemic," she said. "We are not getting there any other way."
Ms. Powell did not respond to a request for comment.
To deal with vaccine misinformation, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social media sites have expanded their policies to fact-check and demote such posts. Facebook and YouTube said they would remove false claims about the vaccines, while Twitter said it pointed people to credible public health sources.
The flow of vaccine falsehoods began rising in recent weeks as it became clear that the coronavirus vaccines would soon be approved and available. Misinformation spreaders glommed onto interviews by health experts and began twisting them.
On Dec. 3, for example, Dr. Kelly Moore, the associate director for immunization education at the nonprofit Immunization Action Coalition, said in an interview with CNN that when people receive the vaccine, "everyone will be issued a written card" that would "tell them what vaccine they had and when their next dose is due."
Dr. Moore was referring to a standard appointment reminder card that could also be used as a backup vaccine record. But skeptics quickly started saying online that the card was evidence that the U.S. government intended to surveil the population and limit the activities of people who were unvaccinated.
That unfounded idea was further fueled by people like Ms. Powell and her Dec. 4 tweet. Her post pushed the narrative to 47,025 misinformation mentions that week, according to Zignal, making it the No. 1 vaccine misinformation story at the time.
To give more credence to the idea, Ms. Powell also appended a link to an article from ZeroHedge, which claimed that immunity cards would "enable CDC to track Covid-19 vaxx status in database." On Facebook, that article was liked and commented on 24,600 times, according to data from CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned social media analytics tool. It also reached up to one million people.
ZeroHedge did not respond to a request for comment.
In an interview, Dr. Moore said she could not believe how her words had been distorted to seem as if she was supporting surveillance and restrictions on unvaccinated members of the public. "In fact, I was simply describing an ordinary appointment reminder card," she said. "This is an old-school practice that goes on around the world."
Other supporters of Mr. Trump who said the election had been stolen from him also began posting vaccine falsehoods. One was Angela Stanton-King, a former Republican candidate for Congress from Georgia and a former reality TV star. On Dec. 5, she tweeted that her father would be forced to take the coronavirus vaccine, even though in reality the government has not made it mandatory.
"My 78 yr old father tested positive for COVID before Thanksgiving he was told to go home and quarantine with no prescribed medication," Ms. Stanton-King wrote in her tweet, which was liked and shared 13,200 times. "He had zero symptoms and is perfectly fine. Help me understand why we need a mandatory vaccine for a virus that heals itself..."
Ms. Stanton-King declined to comment.
Anti-vaccination activists have also jumped in. When two people in Britain had an adverse reaction to Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine this month, Mr. Kennedy, a son of former Senator Robert F. Kennedy who campaigns against vaccines as chairman of the anti-vaccination group Children's Health Defense, pushed the unproven notion on Facebook that ingredients in the vaccine led to the reactions. He stripped out context that such reactions are usually very rare and it is not yet known whether the vaccines caused them.
His Facebook post was shared 556 times and reached nearly a million people, according to CrowdTangle data. In an email, Mr. Kennedy said the Food and Drug Administration should "require pre-screening" of vaccine recipients and "monitor allergic and autoimmune reactions," without acknowledging that regulators have already said they would do so.
Ms. Ryan, the disinformation researcher, said that as long as there were loopholes for misinformation to stay up on social media platforms, purveyors would continue pushing falsehoods about the news topic of the day. It could be QAnon today, the election tomorrow, Covid-19 vaccines after that, she said.
"They need to stay relevant," she said. "Without Trump, they're going to need new hobbies."

Full text: with Tonya Riley
Europe's proposed rules for online businesses would solidify its reputation as the world's toughest tech regulator.
The European Union yesterday unveiled a pair of proposals that could force tech companies to more aggressively police their platforms for harmful content and also put new restrictions on how large companies compete with smaller rivals. The rules carry fines with up to 10 percent of the companies' global revenue, and repeated violations could force a breakup of the companies, my colleague Michael Birnbaum reports. 
The rules would build on the aggressive stance the European Union has already taken on regulating American tech companies' data privacy practices under its sweeping General Data Protection Regulation. Ireland's Data Protection Commission yesterday brought an approximately $546,000 fine against Twitter for not properly documenting or notifying authorities of a data breach that became public in January 2019.
Europe is moving much faster than the United States in forming tech regulations.
That is potentially giving the E.U. the opportunity to influence tech regulation throughout the world, as countries including the United States move to more aggressively regulate the tech industry. Already, GDPR is influencing how companies manage their data, and U.S. lawmakers have asked European officials and companies about it as they craft privacy regulations.
The new proposals – known as the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act – could be next.
"Since the global market is adopting our standards, if we push forward, we'll be the first ones crafting the rules," Eline Chivot, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Data Innovation, a Brussels think tank, told Michael. "Everyone will follow our lead."
With yesterday's proposal, leaders in Brussels are moving to address issues that are still under fierce debate in the halls of Congress – including how much responsibility . The European Union also moved much earlier in bringing antitrust charges against major American tech companies, something that regulators are just beginning to do in the United States with high-profile cases against Google and Facebook setting off what are likely to be years-long processes.
The Digital Markets Act could force major changes in how tech giants operate.
The proposed rules center on preventing so-called "gatekeepers" from using their position in the market to give their own services priority over smaller rivals. They could have major implications for large companies including Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.
(Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post).
The rules would prevent the companies from using data gathered by their services to launch products or services that go up against competitors – which is a major concern of U.S. lawmakers raised about Facebook and Amazon in their recent investigation of competition in Silicon Valley. They would also prevent the companies from giving their own services special preference when deciding how to rank them on screens.
Experts say its likely the proposal could force major changes to Google and Apple's app stores, my colleague Reed Albergotti reports.
The legislation likely allows app developers to inform their customers that they can subscribe to digital services directly, circumventing the App Store, where Apple collects a 30 percent cut on most digital service sales, Damien Geradin, a competition lawyer based in Brussels who has represented clients opposed to Apple. The 30 percent cut is at the center of the criticism of Apple and many the allegations of anticompetitive behavior by the iPhone maker.
The new laws also appear to prohibit Apple from requiring developers to use "Sign in with Apple," a new service that competes with similar offerings from companies like Google.
The Digital Services Act aims to improve online safety through increased scrutiny of the biggest tech companies.
The rules governing companies obligations on content moderation are on a sliding scale, with the largest tech companies required to take on greater responsibilities. All companies under the law must provide users with a clear terms of service.
The biggest tech companies would face fines if they don't do enough to stamp out illegal content such as hate speech. They would also have to participate in regular independent audits of their systems. The largest companies would have to share data about their content moderation practices with authorities and researchers.
"We have such an increase in online traffic that we need to create rules to bring order into chaos," said European Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager, who has been aggressively facing off against American tech companies.
The crackdown is prompting a surge in lobbying in Europe.
The draft legislation comes as Europe is also considering major changes to the rules governing how U.S. companies handle E.U. customers data, following a ruling from Europe's highest court that struck down a key data law. American companies and trade groups are aggressively lobbying to shape the rules. Companies had mixed reactions.
"We are concerned that they appear to specifically target a handful of companies and make it harder to develop new products to support small businesses in Europe," Karan Bhatia, Google's vice president of government affairs and public policy, said in a statement. "We will continue to advocate for new rules that support innovation, increase responsibility and promote economic recovery to the benefit of European consumers and businesses."
Yet Facebook praised the rules for being "on the right track."
Apple declined to comment. An Amazon spokesman pointed to a recent statement that the firm was concerned about "ensuring the same rules apply to all companies."
Our top tabsFacebook will lift its ban on political ads in Georgia. But it will continue to bar them throughout the rest of the country.
The change effective today comes ahead of the Jan. 5 Senate runoffs, according to a blog post released by Facebook. Democratic advertisers warned the ban could hurt their chances in the high-stakes runoffs, which will determine which party controls the Senate.
"With early in-person voting already underway for the runoffs, Facebook's decision to finally lift its harmful ban on political ads in Georgia is long overdue," Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Stewart Boss wrote in an emailed statement. "These online platforms must focus on rooting out the spread of organic disinformation about our elections, and banning ads is the opposite of a solution."
The news is a partial win for political advertisers. Because they will only be able to target users in Georgia, campaigns still won't be able to run ads soliciting donations from across the country.
Google lifted its ban last week for all political ads. Facebook has not said when it will lift its ban in its entirety.
A coalition of states could file an antitrust lawsuit against Google as early as Thursday.
The complaint is expected to accuse Google of changing its search engine to disadvantage specialized search rivals like TripAdvisor and Yelp, Leah Nylen at Politico first reported. The complaint will be led by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser (D) and Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson (R.)
The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in October alleging that Google's contracts with cellphone companies like Apple to be the default search engine are exclusionary and reinforce Google's dominance. Republican attorneys general from 11 states signed on to that suit.
The new Google suit is expected to be filed in the same federal court in D.C. Google says it plans to fight the Justice Department suit.
People affiliated with the French military used fake Facebook accounts to influence African politics.
The company identified fake Facebook groups, pages and Instagram accounts affiliated with people from France and Russia seeking to influence politics in Africa, Craig Timberg reports.
The takedown is the first time the social media giant has targeted users affiliated with a Western government over suspected inauthentic behavior. Facebook did not have evidence that the French military directed the users. The Russian accounts belong to people once affiliated with Russia's Internet Research Agency, which interfered aggressively in the 2016 U.S. presidential election
The takedown is also a rare discovery of rival influence operations from two different countries going head to head to influence a third nation, researchers from Graphika and the Stanford Internet observatory noted in a report Tuesday. The accounts from each side accused the other of being fake and posting narratives aimed against each other's governments.
The French network included 84 Facebook accounts and several groups and pages that posed as Africans supportive of French military action. The Russian accounts attempted to influence opinions about the Dec. 27 election in the Central African Republic and pushed narratives about coronavirus vaccines.
"This shows that the U.S. is, by far, not the country with the worst foreign interference in our politics," said Shelby Grossman, a research scholar at the Stanford Internet Observatory and co-author of the organization's report on the Russian accounts.

Transition TrackerJoe Biden will nominate Pete Buttigieg to be transportation secretary.
The former South Bend, Ind., mayor and presidential candidate would oversee Biden's promises to invest in new transportation and other infrastructure, Michael Laris, Ian Duncan and Seung Min Kim report. As head of the agency, Buttigieg would direct oversight of driverless technology. Safety advocates have urged Biden to take a much more hands-on approach to regulating the emerging technology.
IBM, which works with the airline industry, welcomed the nomination.
"As Congress considers broader, bipartisan infrastructure reform, IBM stands ready to work with the incoming Secretary to modernize our transportation infrastructure and drive economic recovery," Dee Waddell, IBM global managing director of travel and transportation industries, said in a statement.
Hill happeningsSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) wants to give Congress an ultimatum over reforming a key tech liability shield.
The legislation would sunset the decades-old law protecting Internet companies from liability for user content by 2023 if Congress doesn't reform the law.
"The time has come for these largely unregulated Big Tech giants to either be broken up, regulated, or subject to litigation for their actions," Graham said in a statement. "It's time we put the Section 230 protections these companies enjoy on the clock."
The bill, which is unlikely to pass, serves as a last-ditch fix to satisfy President Trump, who threatened to veto the national defense spending bill if Congress doesn't revise the law. The defense spending bill passed last week with majorities that would allow both chambers to overrule a veto.
Graham previously introduced the EARN IT Act, which would strip companies of the liability protections if their users share child exploitation material. Democrats have introduced their own plans to update the law.
Internet companies are trying to get ahead of the debate over the law, which will rage into 2021, by forming a new lobbying coalition. Automattic, Cloudflare, Dropbox, eBay, Etsy, Glassdoor, GoDaddy, Medium, Nextdoor, Patreon, Pinterest, Reddit, Snap, TripAdvisor, Vimeo and the Wikimedia Foundation announced yesterday that they were forming a coalition called Internet Works to raise potential consequences of repealing the law to members of Congress.

Full text: Election-related falsehoods have subsided, but misleading claims about the coronavirus vaccines are surging — often spread by the same people.
Sidney Powell, a lawyer who was part of President Trump’s legal team, spread a conspiracy theory last month about election fraud. For days, she claimed that she would “release the Kraken” by showing voluminous evidence that Mr. Trump had won the election by a landslide.
But after her assertions were widely derided and failed to gain legal traction, Ms. Powell started talking about a new topic. On Dec. 4, she posted a link on Twitter with misinformation that said that the population would be split into the vaccinated and the unvaccinated and that “big government” could surveil those who were unvaccinated.
“NO WAY #America,” Ms. Powell wrote in the tweet, which collected 22,600 shares and 51,000 likes. “This is more authoritarian communist control imported straight from #China.” She then tagged Mr. Trump and the former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn — both of whom she had represented — and other prominent right-wing figures to highlight the post.
Ms. Powell’s changing tune was part of a broader shift in online misinformation. As Mr. Trump’s challenges to the election’s results have been knocked down and the Electoral College has affirmed President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s win, voter fraud misinformation has subsided. Instead, peddlers of online falsehoods are ramping up lies about the Covid-19 vaccines, which were administered to Americans for the first time this week.
Apart from Ms. Powell, others who have spread political misinformation such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican of Georgia, as well as far-right websites like ZeroHedge, have begun pushing false vaccine narratives, researchers said. Their efforts have been amplified by a robust network of anti-vaccination activists like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on platforms including Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.
Among their misleading notions is the idea that the vaccines are delivered with a microchip or bar code to keep track of people, as well as a lie that the vaccines will hurt everyone’s health (the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been proved to be more than 94 percent effective in trials, with minimal side effects). Falsehoods about Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist who supports vaccines, have also increased, with rumors that he is responsible for the coronavirus and that he stands to profit from a vaccine, according to data from media insights company Zignal Labs.
The shift shows how political misinformation purveyors are hopping from topic to topic to maintain attention and influence, said Melissa Ryan, chief executive of Card Strategies, a consulting firm that researches disinformation.
It is “an easy pivot,” she said. “Disinformation about vaccines and the pandemic have long been staples of the pro-Trump disinformation playbook.”
The change has been particularly evident over the last six weeks. Election misinformation peaked on Nov. 4 at 375,000 mentions across cable television, social media, print and online news outlets, according to an analysis by Zignal. By Dec. 3, that had fallen to 60,000 mentions. But coronavirus misinformation steadily increased over that period, rising to 46,100 mentions on Dec. 3, from 17,900 mentions on Nov. 8.
NewsGuard, a start-up that fights false stories, said that of the 145 websites in its Election Misinformation Tracking Center, a database of sites that publish false election information, 60 percent of them have also published misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic. That includes right-wing outlets such as Breitbart, Newsmax and One America News Network, which distributed inaccurate articles about the election and are now also running misleading articles about the vaccines.
John Gregory, the deputy health editor for NewsGuard, said the shift was not to be taken lightly because false information about vaccines leads to real-world harm. In Britain in the early 2000s, he said, a baseless link between the measles vaccine and autism spooked people into not taking that vaccine. That led to deaths and serious permanent injuries, he said.
“Misinformation creates fear and uncertainty around the vaccine and can reduce the number of people willing to take it,” said Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington evolutionary biologist who has been tracking the pandemic.
Dr. Shira Doron, an epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center, said the consequences of people not taking the Covid-19 vaccines because of misinformation would be catastrophic. The vaccines are “the key piece to ending the pandemic,” she said. “We are not getting there any other way.”
Ms. Powell did not respond to a request for comment.
To deal with vaccine misinformation, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social media sites have expanded their policies to fact-check and demote such posts. Facebook and YouTube said they would remove false claims about the vaccines, while Twitter said it pointed people to credible public health sources.
The flow of vaccine falsehoods began rising in recent weeks as it became clear that the coronavirus vaccines would soon be approved and available. Misinformation spreaders glommed onto interviews by health experts and began twisting them.
On Dec. 3, for example, Dr. Kelly Moore, the associate director for immunization education at the nonprofit Immunization Action Coalition, said in an interview with CNN that when people receive the vaccine, “everyone will be issued a written card” that would “tell them what vaccine they had and when their next dose is due.”
Dr. Moore was referring to a standard appointment reminder card that could also be used as a backup vaccine record. But skeptics quickly started saying online that the card was evidence that the U.S. government intended to surveil the population and limit the activities of people who were unvaccinated.
That unfounded idea was further fueled by people like Ms. Powell and her Dec. 4 tweet. Her post pushed the narrative to 47,025 misinformation mentions that week, according to Zignal, making it the No. 1 vaccine misinformation story at the time.
To give more credence to the idea, Ms. Powell also appended a link to an article from ZeroHedge, which claimed that immunity cards would “enable CDC to track Covid-19 vaxx status in database.” On Facebook, that article was liked and commented on 24,600 times, according to data from CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned social media analytics tool. It also reached up to one million people.
ZeroHedge did not respond to a request for comment.
In an interview, Dr. Moore said she could not believe how her words had been distorted to seem as if she was supporting surveillance and restrictions on unvaccinated members of the public. “In fact, I was simply describing an ordinary appointment reminder card,” she said. “This is an old-school practice that goes on around the world.”
Other supporters of Mr. Trump who said the election had been stolen from him also began posting vaccine falsehoods. One was Angela Stanton-King, a former Republican candidate for Congress from Georgia and a former reality TV star. On Dec. 5, she tweeted that her father would be forced to take the coronavirus vaccine, even though in reality the government has not made it mandatory.
“My 78 yr old father tested positive for COVID before Thanksgiving he was told to go home and quarantine with no prescribed medication,” Ms. Stanton-King wrote in her tweet, which was liked and shared 13,200 times. “He had zero symptoms and is perfectly fine. Help me understand why we need a mandatory vaccine for a virus that heals itself…”
Ms. Stanton-King declined to comment.
Anti-vaccination activists have also jumped in. When two people in Britain had an adverse reaction to Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine this month, Mr. Kennedy, a son of former Senator Robert F. Kennedy who campaigns against vaccines as chairman of the anti-vaccination group Children’s Health Defense, pushed the unproven notion on Facebook that ingredients in the vaccine led to the reactions. He stripped out context that such reactions are usually very rare and it is not yet known whether the vaccines caused them.
His Facebook post was shared 556 times and reached nearly a million people, according to CrowdTangle data. In an email, Mr. Kennedy said the Food and Drug Administration should “require pre-screening” of vaccine recipients and “monitor allergic and autoimmune reactions,” without acknowledging that regulators have already said they would do so.
Ms. Ryan, the disinformation researcher, said that as long as there were loopholes for misinformation to stay up on social media platforms, purveyors would continue pushing falsehoods about the news topic of the day. It could be QAnon today, the election tomorrow, Covid-19 vaccines after that, she said.
“They need to stay relevant,” she said. “Without Trump, they’re going to need new hobbies.”

Full text: The coronavirus didn't seem like a big deal to Craig Buescher at first. Still, he thought he was being careful.
He wore a mask in public — most of the time. He limited his circle of friends, but still saw six or eight people. He largely followed the rules, but admits that he occasionally stretched them.
Buescher was 69 and in good health. Surely, he thought, the virus wouldn't be that bad if he came down with it.
While he doesn't know how he ultimately contracted the virus, it was, in fact, quite bad. Nine days in the hospital, as he struggled to breathe, convinced him that not only did he need to be more careful to avoid the virus, but also that he should persuade others to do the same.
"I couldn't walk across the room without stopping," said Buescher, of South Bend, Neb. "That proved to be the thing that made a believer out of me."
For all those like Buescher, who has become more cautious since the pandemic was declared in March, millions of others continue to resist recommended precautions or have stopped following public health guidance because of pandemic fatigue. Officials and health experts are sounding the alarm about the virus's dangerous surge — the United States is logging more than 160,000 new infections per day on average — while many desperately try to determine how to persuade people to change their behavior.
To be sure, plenty of Americans are heeding officials' advice to limit their time in public places, avoid small gatherings and stay away from large crowds. But a Gallup poll conducted in September found that the numbers of people who report doing each of those things have been trending downward and are at their lowest levels since March: 70 percent said they had avoided large crowds in the past week, 53 percent had stayed away from public places and 45 percent had forgone small gatherings.
Most people who are ignoring public health recommendations probably either don't perceive themselves as at-risk for severe consequences of the coronavirus or don't believe the suggested behaviors will protect them, experts say.
Social norms also have a big impact on decision-making. In places where most people are following the guidelines, others are likely to follow. Because the United States did not create uniform norms early in the pandemic, wearing masks and maintaining distance are still unpopular in some places.
Changing those norms by highlighting the many people who are following the rules could be key to persuading others to alter their behavior, research shows.
"Even when we know what we SHOULD be doing, if we find out that other people aren't doing it, we probably won't do it," Vanessa Bohns, who teaches organizational behavior at Cornell University, wrote in an email. "Interestingly, lots of persuasive messaging undermines itself by saying, 'You should do this,' and then immediately afterwards saying, 'But most people aren't doing this.'"
Meeting the virus face-to-face
Despite attempts to shift social norms, experts say the most effective factor in shifting people's behavior may still be personal encounters with the dangers of the virus. While many Americans still flout public health measures after having close experiences with the pathogen, psychologists are hopeful that there's a tipping point at which the amount of people who act more cautiously after a personal experience will affect the pandemic's trajectory.
For Buescher, it took getting sick for him to buckle down on mask-wearing and social distancing. His brush with covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, came in September, when he noticed that his legs were weak and he felt tired all the time. He said his doctor prescribed him medication and urged him to go to an emergency room if his blood-oxygen level dipped below 90 percent.
Soon it did, Buescher said, and his wife drove him to the hospital. After eight days of supplemental oxygen, his daughter told him that his doctors warned her at one point that they would have to put him on a ventilator if his breathing didn't improve.
The experience left Buescher a changed man — one who keeps two or three masks in each of the family's cars so they're always prepared, and he has tightened his social circle to one other couple. He and his wife celebrated Thanksgiving with their four adult children over Zoom, and they're rethinking their Christmas plans.
"There'll be other Christmases," Buescher said, "unless we're not responsible."
Buescher has also become an evangelist for coronavirus-conscious decision-making. He makes sure to wear a mask when he goes into a business, even though he's now unlikely to be infectious, because he wants to set a good example. He's been sharing his covid-19 experience with others through Facebook posts. And he recently spoke at one of Gov. Pete Ricketts's news conferences to urge fellow Nebraskans to be cautious.
"Is this something we're going to do every year?" Buescher said at the news conference, of his family's plan to celebrate Thanksgiving virtually. "No, we've got to do it this year so that we have the capabilities of getting back on track next year."
As word spread in his small town that the virus hit him hard, Buescher said others have told him that hearing about his experience changed their own behavior. One of those friends was Chuck Baum, who said he felt at the onset of the pandemic like the constant crush of coronavirus news might be just a lot of crying wolf.
It wasn't that Baum and his wife weren't taking any precautions. He got sent home from his job in the livestock industry. They paused their habit of eating at a restaurant every other week. Neither of them went to big weddings or funerals anymore.
But the virus seemed to be on every TV station, all the time. Who knew how bad it really was?
"At some point in time, you tune the news media out," said Baum, of Denton, Neb. "Until you start knowing people that are dying, then it becomes real."
Buescher wasn't the only person who helped make the virus feel more real to Baum. First it was a friend in his 60s, who died in March. Then his college roommate's father succumbed to the virus. In October, one of his customers died two days after Baum found out the man was sick.
The biggest change Baum said he has made since seeing friends die of the virus is no longer going inside his 92-year-old mother's house. He has visited her twice in the past month, but now he opens the kitchen door and the screen door and talks to her from outside.
That kind of change is unsurprising to Donald Edmondson, who leads the Science of Behavior Change, a network supported by the National Institutes of Health that uses experimental medicine to study behavior change. As more members of a community become seriously ill and die of covid-19, Edmondson said, the norms in that area are likely to eventually change.
"There has to be a point at which there's a feedback loop that begins to shift behaviors," he said.
Choosing the right messenger
Talking to people about the dangers of the virus can also influence people's behavior, but only if the message is coming from someone they trust, experts say. A breakdown of faith in institutions has left many skeptical of anything they're told by government officials, academics or journalists.
Some people are so mired in disinformation that experts believe it would be hard to persuade them to change their behaviors. Nearly 1 in 5 U.S. adults believes the coronavirus is less lethal than the seasonal flu, and 41 percent think the official coronavirus death toll has been overstated, according to a Gallup/Knight Foundation poll conducted in September.
"The best bang for your buck is going to be those people who are on the fence who are just tired," said Jay Van Bavel, an associate professor of psychology at New York University. "You can probably get through to more of them than people who are just very far gone."
For those who consume mostly accurate information, the key is for people to directly encourage their family members and friends to make safe choices. Van Bavel pointed as an example to social media campaigns such as the "Ice Bucket Challenge," which made waves online in 2014 and raised millions of dollars for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) research.
It's important for public health officials to communicate risk-mitigation measures to people who will listen, Van Bavel said, but it's equally crucial that those people share them with their loved ones who aren't inclined to believe authority figures. People are more inclined to agree to requests from people they like, research shows.
For those who have been convinced by arguments that wearing masks or maintaining social distance are an assault on freedom, Van Bavel said he would redefine freedom as the ability to move through society more freely if everyone takes precautions such as wearing masks. He said people are sensitive to the idea that they are losing something, so he would also suggest that the real risk is not losing freedom.
"I would frame it as, the real risk of loss is not missing a holiday with the family," Van Bavel said. "It's missing the family — having them die or have permanent lung damage or brain damage or psychiatric problems."
With access to coronavirus vaccines on the horizon, experts say there's another strategy for persuading people to be cautious: reminding them that the pandemic's end is in sight and they wouldn't want to contract the virus soon before they could have been inoculated.
Van Bavel compared the situation to the "marshmallow test," a well-known psychological experiment in which a child could either eat a marshmallow right away or stay unaccompanied with it in the room for up to 20 minutes and then receive two marshmallows as a reward for her patience.
"We're now in a marshmallow test as a society," Van Bavel said. "We need to tell people that you can have those two marshmallows, you can have lots of gatherings with family, lots of trips, lots of economic activities, if you can just hold off for a few minutes and not eat the marshmallow right now."

Full text: If offered a coronavirus vaccine free of charge, fewer than half of Black people and 66 percent of Latino people said they would definitely or probably take it, according to a survey-based study that underscores the challenge of getting vaccines to communities hit hard by the pandemic.
The survey released Monday is one of the largest and most rigorous to date. Other recent studies have also pointed to vaccine hesitancy in communities of color, but Monday's survey delved deeper into the reasons, polling respondents on a spectrum of questions to get at the roots of their distrust.
Perhaps its most sobering findings: 14 percent of Black people trust that a vaccine will be safe, and 18 percent trust that it will be effective in shielding them from the coronavirus. Among Latinos, 34 percent trust its safety, and 40 percent trust its effectiveness.
The survey was conducted Sept. 1 through 15, before interim analyses were released showing that three experimental vaccines had achieved high levels of protection against the coronavirus and appeared largely safe.
The study's authors said trust in vaccine safety is especially critical and was found in subsequent questions to be by far the strongest predictor of whether people are willing to take the vaccine.
Vaccinating a large share of the U.S. population will prove pivotal to establishing national immunity to the novel coronavirus and slowing the spread of the pathogen, infectious-disease specialists say. To reach the threshold necessary to establish herd immunity, a majority of Americans will likely need to be vaccinated in coming years.
But even as pharmaceutical companies release encouraging data on three experimental vaccines and officials throughout the country build a complex infrastructure of distribution chains and ultracold freezers, it is becoming increasingly clear the country will face profound challenges in trust and uptake of the vaccine.
"It's not having a vaccine that saves lives, it's people actually getting vaccinated," said Michelle A. Williams, dean of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who co-founded the COVID Collaborative, the nonprofit that commissioned the study. "For that to happen, we need to understand why so many are hesitant and help overcome that."
Getting coronavirus vaccines to communities of color is especially important because those communities have disproportionately borne the burden of the pandemic.
Nearly nine months after the virus exploded in the United States, Black, Asian, Native American and Hispanic patients still die far more frequently than White patients, even as death rates have plummeted for all races and age groups, The Washington Post found, after analyzing the records of 5.8 million people who tested positive for the virus from early March through mid-October.
Officials are wrestling with how to ensure that vulnerable populations receive the vaccine. Almost certainly at the top of the list: about 21 million front-line health-care workers. But after them will probably be other essential workers, many of whom come from Black, Latino and Asian communities. Many can't work from home, don't have transportation and live in crowded housing.
For many Black people, the lack of trust in the coronavirus vaccine is rooted in history, some experts said.
"On one hand in this country, you have the anti-vaxxers and the unfounded disinformation they push," said Alexandre White, an expert at Johns Hopkins University who studies the sociology and history of epidemic response. "But what you see from minorities is a hesitancy that is quite rooted in historical reality."
The bodies of Black people who were enslaved were used by medical schools for anatomy dissections. Black women were used for gynecologic research, experimentation and sterilization, White noted.
At a meeting last month of Food and Drug Administration officials and vaccine experts, the worries of several people of color were read aloud from a recent focus group on vaccines:
"I firmly believe that this is another Tuskegee experiment."
"I would not be first in line and I would want to see some data."
"We are not going to be guinea pigs again."
For many in the Black community, the Tuskegee syphilis study — a secret experiment conducted by the U.S. government to study the deadly venereal disease without treatment — looms especially large in the collective memory, experts said.
Monday's survey — which found 48 percent of African Americans said they would definitely or probably get the vaccine — found that knowledge of the Tuskegee study was among the predictors for whether a Black respondent would be willing to take the vaccine. Other factors included strength of their racial identity, previous flu vaccine experience, partisanship, sex, age and education.
For Latino people, similar factors were the main predictors in vaccine acceptance. But also included was their level of trust in the government to look out for the best interests of Latino people and whether the individual lived in the suburbs.
The survey was conducted by Langer Research, a New York-based survey research firm that collaborates with The Washington Post on its joint ABC-Post polls.
The study collected questionnaire responses from 1,050 Black and 258 Latino adults. The respondents consisted of a nationally representative random sample administered online.
The same group that sponsored the study also announced a partnership Monday with the Ad Council to combat vaccine hesitancy in communities of color.
"America needs to do more to tap ingenuity and expertise, particularly at this time of national crisis and presidential transition," said John Bridgeland, co-founder of the COVID Collaborative.
While the survey studied only the Black and Latino communities in depth, the nonprofit that commissioned the report and other experts have expressed similar concerns about vaccine hesitancy among Native Americans, Asians and other minority groups.
Other efforts in recent weeks have shown the hurdles and resistance such efforts may encounter.
When the presidents of two historically Black colleges announced they were volunteering as test subjects for an experimental vaccine for the coronavirus, they were met with backlash from Black parents and accusations that they were condoning experimentation on the Black community.
The men's decision to share their participation in the trials is part of an effort among African American leaders to address the mistrust they worry puts communities of color in greater danger.
Others Black leaders have tried to address the mistrust.
Michigan's lieutenant governor, Garlin Gilchrist II (D), tweeted about his recent flu shot. And the Rev. Jesse Jackson said at his 79th birthday celebration last month in Chicago that his wish was that people of color protect themselves from the virus by following public health protocols.
A similar survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Undefeated last month similarly found that 49 percent of African Americans said they would not take a vaccine even if scientists deemed it safe and made it free to anyone who wants it.
That hesitancy comes despite people in communities of color being much more likely to know someone who has suffered from covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.
In Monday's survey, 55 percent of Black people said they knew someone diagnosed with covid-19, and 48 percent knew someone who had been hospitalized with or died from covid-19. The numbers were even higher among Latinos, with 73 percent knowing someone diagnosed and 52 percent knowing someone who had been hospitalized or died from covid-19.
Howard University President Wayne A.I. Frederick, a physician, said Black health-care providers need to stress the importance of vaccinations in their communities so they feel confident about receiving them.
"The average African American cannot give you details of Tuskegee. Their mistrust is of institutions, of government institutions, of law enforcement, and that mistrust spreads across our community," Frederick said. He was one of several leading Black medical experts who have united to form the Black Coalition Against COVID-19 and held a news conference last week.
The study found that African Americans were twice as likely to trust a messenger from their own racial group compared with a White counterpart.
"The best messengers are going to be influencers from within their own communities," said Williams, from Harvard. "And very clearly, personal physicians from minority communities are going to be very important in this effort."

Full text: with Tonya Riley
As false claims continue to fly about the 2020 election, officials and experts are already preparing for the next big disinformation fight over coronavirus vaccines.
Phony claims about the effectiveness or side effects of vaccines could prolong the virus's impact and further damage an already staggering economy. But such claims are already swirling online about promising vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer that could be available on a limited basis before the end of the year, experts who track disinformation campaigns told me.
They include unfounded claims the vaccines aren't sufficiently tested, that they'll produce damaging side effects and that they're being secretly funded by billionaires such as George Soros and Bill Gates.
"The disinformation war is about to shift from targeting voters to targeting vaccines and the stakes will be lives," Peter Singer, a fellow at the New America think tank who has written extensively about information warfare, told me.
The phony claims are being spread largely by domestic actors, including critics of traditional vaccines, Renée DiResta, a research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory who investigates the online spread of disinformation, told me.
"Story lines that were laid down at the beginning of the summer are being reconstituted to specifically tie them to Moderna and Pfizer as their vaccines show positive results," she said.
But such disinformation could be amplified by Russia and other U.S. adversaries.
"The longer we struggle with covid, the less trust our allies have in us, the more chaos they can sow. That's pain they can inflict on us," Clint Watts, adistinguished research fellowat the Foreign Policy Research Institute who tracks Russian influence operations, told me.
The groups knocking back these phony claims will be doing so in an environment that's already toxic because of the election and PresidentTrump's refusal to concede.
Trump and congressional Republicans have savaged social media companies for fact checking and labeling the president's unfounded claims about election fraud — both before and after the voting concluded. That has burned through much of the good will those companies might have hoped for in the vaccine disinformation fight.
Trump and his allies have also attacked top federal officials in charge of combating disinformation for disputing the president's baseless claims of election fraud — including FBI Director Christopher A. Wray and Chris Krebs, head of the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
"[Trump] undermines government efforts by going out and spreading conspiracies, which makes it very difficult for those agencies to be trusted," Watts said. "If you had unity at home in terms of the truth, you could repel this stuff from abroad much easier."
CISA may be especially hobbled in its efforts to combat vaccine disinformation.
The agency drew Trump's ire for running a rumor control Web page that knocked back phony election claims — including some made by the president himself.
The White House was mulling firing Krebs as recently as this weekend for allegedly refusing to edit or remove some of the fact checks, though Krebs was still employed on Monday.
Krebs regularly touted the rumor control page to reporters and said he'd like to create a similar page geared to coronavirus disinformation. Those plans may be on hold now, with Krebs's future at the agency in question — removing a key trusted source to vet such information.
CISA representatives did not respond yesterday to my queries about vaccine rumor control.
"We need authority figures and people who enjoy public trust to step in and create content around this just to make sure they don't cede the ground to people with bad intentions," DiResta said.
On the plus side, Trump is unlikely to amplify disinformation that undermines confidence in the vaccines as he did about the election.
In fact, the president has mostly been eager to take credit for the vaccines being developed on his watch.
That could dull any inclination by his supporters to embrace or pass along phony claims.
"One out of three Americans still sees him as a trusted source of information and maybe one out of four Americans believes everything he says. So, if he's right on this that's better," Watts told me.
Some analysts fear, however, Trump could shift course and start sowing unfounded doubts about vaccines after President-elect Joe Biden takes office.
"My fear is that he starts throwing false claims and creating uncertainty about the vaccine and its side effects to attract attention, to stay in the news and to disrupt the Biden administration as much as he can," Singer said.
The keysGeorgia's secretary of state says fellow Republicans are pressuring him to reject legal ballots.
Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) was among those who asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) whether he had the power to reduce the number of votes counted, including by tossing all mail ballots in counties with higher rates of non-matching signatures, Amy Gardner reports.
Graham denied the allegations. He said he merely contacted Raffensperger to understand how the state's signature-matching requirements work. "If he feels threatened by that conversation, he's got a problem," Graham said. "I actually thought it was a good conversation."
The same day, a Trump supporter filed a lawsuit over Georgia's signature-matching law. Raffensperger said he would defend the state against the lawsuit.
Georgia is conducting a hand audit of about 5 million ballots cast in the state. Raffensperger has drawn the ire of Republicans by refusing to endorseTrump's unfounded claims of fraud in a state Biden appears to have narrowly won.
Raffensperger attacked his critics in a Facebook thread that righted incorrect claims about the state's election process. He called Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), who's leading Trump's efforts to dispute results there, "a liar" and said he would "fight any and all federal overreach to takeover Georgia's elections."
He also expressed concerns that conspiracy theories about Dominion voting machines spread by Trump and his allies could create problems for the state's runoff elections in January for its two Senate seats, which could decide whether Republicans or Democrats control the chamber.
"I don't think it's helpful when you create doubt in the election process," Raffensperger told Amy. "People might throw up their arms and say, 'Why vote?' "
In a separate development yesterday, dozens of leading specialists in election security signed a letter stating they saw no credible evidence of computer fraud in the 2020 election. They also called on policymakers to endorse measures such as paper ballots and post-election audits to improve voter confidence.
More from Politico's Eric Geller:
House Democrats will hold leadership elections virtually for the first time.
The members will use an app on government-issued iPhones to vote, Paulina Firozi and Paul Kane report. Republicans will still hold their leadership vote in person.
The move highlights a stark partisan divide over the use of virtual voting during the pandemic.
Last week House Democrats released a report expressing confidence members could vote remotely using secure technology. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) dismissed the proposed operation as "unproved, unsecure and unconstitutional."
Election security experts have warned against voting on mobile devices in traditional elections with secret ballots, but raised far fewer concerns in instances where votes are public and voters can verify they're correct.
The military is buying location data of unsuspecting app users.
The military has been scooping up anonymized location data from popular apps including a Muslim prayer app with 98 million downloads, a Muslim dating site and a weather app, Joseph Cox at Motherboard reports.
The findings come as lawmakers are increasingly scrutinizing how the U.S. government, including DHS and the IRS, are using commercial location data with little or no oversight.
The military purchased the data through two middlemen, a contractor named Babel Street and the data broker X-Mode, which obtained it from the apps themselves.
A military representative said that the data was used for overseas operations and that it strictly adheres to "established procedures and policies for protecting the privacy, civil liberties, constitutional and legal rights of American citizens."
Although location data purchased by the military is anonymized, a former Babel street employee says the company was capable of deanonymizing the data. Other Babel Street clients have included government contractors.
X-Mode told Motherboard it licenses data to contractors for "counter-terrorism, cybersecurity and predicting future COVID-19 hotspots." Several apps using X-Mode had no idea their users' data was being passed along to the military.
On the move
Twitter named Peiter Zatko, a famous hacker widely known by his handle Mudge, as its new head of security, Reuters reported. Zatko most recently worked at Stripe and has experience working with the Pentagon.

Full text: with Mariana Alfaro
Some of President-elect Joe Biden's advisers and lawyers sounded gung-ho last week about filing a lawsuit aimed at compelling the General Services Administration to allow the transition to move ahead.
Instead of waging a messy legal fight, Biden has chosen to sue for relief in the court of public opinion. He warned during a Monday news conference that President Trump's refusal to allow his transition team to coordinate with federal agencies could slow down the distribution of coronavirus vaccines by a month or more once they are approved.
"More people may die if we don't coordinate," Biden said in Wilmington, Del.
Biden's decision not to file a GSA lawsuit reflects an impulse toward caution that animated his campaign and seems almost certain to define his presidency.
Monday's news conference offered several illustrations.
Biden declined to say whether governors should order new lockdowns or close nonessential businesses. "Look, it depends on the state," he said. Even as he continues to warn of a "very dark winter" to come, in which "things are going to get much tougher before they get easier," Biden's public health advisers tell us he has no plan – or desire – to reimpose a national lockdown when he takes office in January because he's very mindful of the economic consequences of closures.
Biden is not breaking ranks with congressional Democrats on coronavirus relief negotiations. He could publicly endorse holding a vote on the scaled-back package that Senate Republicans want, but instead he expressed support on Monday for the bill that House Democrats advanced several months ago which has been a non-starter with the GOP. Even as Biden called on both sides to work together and to pass legislation immediately, his message was intentionally delivered in a way that would not be interpreted as undercutting the Democratic negotiating position on Capitol Hill.
Biden, who has promised to be more of a transitional president than a transformational one, continues to fill his senior staff with establishment Democrats with whom he feels comfortable. They are the kinds of steady hands who will not rock the ship of state. Incoming chief of staff Ron Klain, the consummate Washington survivor, worked for Biden as a lawyer on the Senate Judiciary Committee in the 1980s and served as his chief of staff during his first term as vice president. Steve Ricchetti, Biden's chief of staff in his second term as V.P., will be named today as counselor to the president, the job Kellyanne Conway held for Trump.
Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.) will announce today in New Orleans that he is giving up his House seat to become the head of public engagement in the White House, a job Valerie Jarrett held in the Obama White House. Richmond, a former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, was an early endorser and has been a member of Biden's kitchen cabinet. He will be a key liaison to the Hill.
Biden also plans to name Jen O'Malley Dillon, who became his campaign manager for the general election after leading Beto O'Rourke's presidential bid during the primaries, to be deputy White House chief of staff. This should be taken as a sign that Biden has every intention of running for reelection in 2024, despite speculation that he does not plan to pursue a second term.
If Republicans win one or both of the Georgia runoffs, which seems more likely than not, Biden is poised to become a historically weak president. Constrained on Capitol Hill, Biden could be forced to lead largely by example.
Wearing a mask while urging others to do so is part of a broader virtue-signaling strategy. Another illustration of that came Monday as the president-elect urged Americans to scale back their Thanksgiving plans by announcing that his own family will limit its celebration to 10 people, as recommended by experts. The comment felt reminiscent of President Jimmy Carter's 1977 announcement, while wearing a cardigan sweater, that he had turned down the White House thermostat to save energy.
"There's nothing macho about not wearing a mask," Biden said.
Trump tweeted Sunday that Biden "won" – but only "because the Election was Rigged." The president quickly walked this back and insisted that that he concedes nothing. Asked about this, Biden responded with a more-in-sadness-than-in-anger vibe. "I interpret that as Trumpianism," Biden said. "No change in his modus operandi. … I find this more embarrassing for the country than debilitating for my ability to get started."
Biden observed how silly it is that, while Vice President-elect Kamala Harris gets classified briefings because she sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, he is not because Trump will not allow them to begin. Instead, Biden is scheduled to receive a national security briefing later today from experts outside government.
Meanwhile, ABC News reports that GSA administrator Emily Murphy, the Trump loyalist who refuses to sign the paperwork to let the transition move forward, is herself searching for a new job after Jan. 20. Murphy sent a message to an associate inquiring about employment opportunities in 2021.
NBC News reports this morning that the president-elect has privately told advisers that he doesn't want his presidency to be consumed by investigations of Trump, despite pressure from some Democrats to pursue them: "Biden has raised concerns that investigations would further divide a country he is trying to unite and risk making every day of his presidency about Trump … He has specifically told advisers that he is wary of federal tax investigations of Trump or of challenging any orders Trump may issue granting immunity to members of his staff before he leaves office. One adviser said Biden has made it clear that he 'just wants to move on.' Another Biden adviser said, 'He's going to be more oriented toward fixing the problems and moving forward than prosecuting them.'"
To be sure, Biden's bid to depoliticize the Justice Department after Bill Barr's hyerpolitical reign as attorney general would not stop state and local prosecutors from pursuing charges against Trump, his children, his staff, his associates and his business, including New York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., who are both Democrats.
Looking back, Biden ran an exceedingly cautious campaign. He behaved in the final months of the race like a football coach trying to run down the clock with a two-touchdown lead in the fourth quarter. The 77-year-old never contracted the coronavirus as a candidate, unlike Trump and most of the president's senior staff, and he won the election. This ultimately validates his prudence.
But the final outcome was almost certainly closer than it would have been if he had traveled more aggressively instead of campaigning and fundraising from his basement for months. Biden's campaign erred by not running an in-person field program during the summer when Trump and the Republicans were running circles around him on voter contact. This might have cost him a state like North Carolina, where Trump prevailed by one percentage point, or about 74,000 votes.
Biden's personal instincts were toward caution and centrism throughout the contest. Last year, in the primaries, the longtime former senator said he opposed adding more justices to the Supreme Court. When court packing became all the rage on the far left after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death, Biden declined to reiterate his previous view for weeks and opened the door to the idea. Facing blowback from the right, Biden announced that he would appoint a commission to explore possible ideas for "court reform." Calling for the creation of a blue-ribbon commission to look into something is the quintessential Washington off-ramp – and a signal of cautiousness. The same can be said for how he talked about Black Lives Matter protests for much of the summer.
Indecision has long been one of his biggest weaknesses. He routinely blows past self-imposed deadlines because he cannot make up his mind. This happened with his campaign kickoff last year and with the vice-presidential selection process over the summer.
The Delawarean's slow-and-steady plodding over half a century has brought him to the precipice of the most powerful job in the world. Biden was the tortoise to Trump's hare. One illustration of Biden putting in the work is his investment in developing personal relationships. Denis McDonough, Barack Obama's former chief of staff, observed to Politico over the summer that Biden, as vice president, "always wanted to have had two conversations with someone before he would ask that person for something. … Once in a while you're like, 'Hey, can we get through those two touches so you can make the ask here,' but he just wouldn't do it. That's the kind of operation he runs."
Something similar appears to be playing out again in Biden's response to the coronavirus. Celine Gounder, a clinical assistant professor at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and a member of Biden's newly formed coronavirus panel, told Annie Linskey and Sean Sullivan on Monday that Biden has privately said that he does not favor national shutdowns like what happened in the spring. She said the Biden strategy is focused instead on invoking the Defense Production Act to increase production of protective equipment such as masks and gowns, increasing testing, and focusing on ensuring the effective production and distribution therapeutics and a vaccine.
"The consensus on the advisory board is that we are not seeking to impose a national lockdown again," Gounder said. Biden, she added, "has not said he would entertain a national lockdown. He has made it very clear in those meetings as well that he really wants to be more targeted in terms of restrictions. … I do not think that is on the table at all. There's a lot that we've learned since the spring."
"Biden's attempts to steer away from shutdowns reveal how toxic his team believes that remedy to be," Linskey and Sullivan report. "Not everyone on the advisory panel has stuck to the same message. Last week Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and a member of the panel, floated national shutdowns lasting from four to six weeks. … Osterholm quickly walked back the idea, saying that it was not one being discussed by Biden's team."
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have not talked recently about covid negotiations," Anne Gearan and Jeff Stein report. "Biden spoke to Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Friday … Biden has [still] not spoken to McConnell … Lawmakers had expressed hope that at least a partial coronavirus relief package could be coupled with an extension in funding for the federal government, which is necessary to avoid a Dec. 11 shutdown. But senior congressional officials have grown increasingly pessimistic that can be achieved in the lame-duck period. … The White House is now expected to take a back seat in negotiations and not offer new stimulus proposals. … Unemployment benefits for millions are set to expire, as are protections for renters and student borrowers amid mounting signs Americans are struggling to pay their utility bills and rent."
"Some argue that [Biden's] lack of clarity on these issues is an attempt to keep his options open. But the nation is increasingly looking to him for guidance," Heather Long notes. "Many left-leaning economists, including Jason Furman, a former chief economist to [Obama], have urged Biden and [Pelosi] to take a smaller deal now to lock in some stimulus funding. Something is better than nothing for millions of struggling Americans and small businesses, they say."
The voting warsGeorgia’s secretary of state says he's facing GOP pressure to discard legitimate ballots.
"Brad Raffensperger said Monday that he has come under increasing pressure in recent days from fellow Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), who he said questioned the validity of legally cast absentee ballots, in an effort to reverse Trump's narrow loss in the state," Amy Gardner reports. "In a wide-ranging interview about the election, Raffensperger expressed exasperation over a string of baseless allegations coming from Trump and his allies about the integrity of the Georgia results, including claims that Dominion Voting Systems, the Colorado-based manufacturer of Georgia's voting machines, is a 'leftist' company with ties to Venezuela that engineered thousands of Trump votes to be left out of the count. The atmosphere has grown so contentious, Raffensperger said, that he and his wife, Tricia, have received death threats in recent days, including a text to him that read: 'You better not botch this recount. Your life depends on it.' … Biden has a 14,000-vote lead …
"The normally mild-mannered Raffensperger saved his harshest language for Rep. Douglas A. Collins (R-Ga.), who is leading the president's efforts in Georgia and whom Raffensperger called a 'liar' and a 'charlatan.' … [Raffensperger] said the hand-counted audit that began last week will also prove the accuracy of the Dominion machines …
"Graham questioned Raffensperger about the state's signature-matching law and whether political bias could have prompted poll workers to accept ballots with nonmatching signatures, according to Raffensperger. Graham also asked whether Raffensperger had the power to toss all mail ballots in counties found to have higher rates of nonmatching signatures, Raffensperger said. Raffensperger said he was stunned that Graham appeared to suggest that he find a way to toss legally cast ballots. Absent court intervention, Raffensperger doesn't have the power to do what Graham suggested … 'It sure looked like he was wanting to go down that road,' Raffensperger said. In an interview on Capitol Hill on Monday evening, Graham denied that he had suggested that Raffensperger toss legal ballots, calling that characterization 'ridiculous.'"
Democrats condemned Graham's alleged intervention. "This is insane and illegal," said Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). "Senate Republicans shouldn't be applying pressure on election officials to overturn the will of the people," said Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.). (Katie Shepherd)
Republicans privately struggle with how to use Trump in the Georgia runoffs.
"Republican leaders are increasingly alarmed about the party's ability to stave off Democratic challengers in Georgia's two Senate runoff elections — and they privately described Trump on a recent conference call as a political burden," Robert Costa and Tom Hamburger report. "Those blunt assessments, which capture a Republican Party in turmoil as Trump refuses to concede to Biden, were made on a Nov. 10 call with donors hosted by the National Republican Senatorial Committee. It featured Georgia's embattled GOP incumbents, Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, and Karl Rove, a veteran strategist who is coordinating fundraising for the Jan. 5 runoffs. … Most striking was the way the senators nodded toward the likelihood of Biden's presidency [even as they continue to pretend otherwise publicly]. …
"Perdue noted later that he had confronted an 'anti-Trump vote in Georgia' in the first round of voting and said the runoff is about getting 'enough conservative Republicans out to vote' in the Atlanta suburbs and elsewhere who might have opposed the president's reelection. 'I'm talking about people that may have voted for Biden but now may come back and vote for us because there was an anti-Trump vote in Georgia,' Perdue said. 'And we think some of those people, particularly in the suburbs, may come back to us.' … Some on the call expressed particular concern about Georgia's fast-changing electorate, driven by the increasingly liberal metro Atlanta region and the push by 2018 gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams to register more Democratic voters … 'They changed, dramatically, the face of the electorate in Georgia. Many of these new voters are from California, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, and they're not of the conservative persuasion,' Perdue said …
"Loeffler and Perdue laid bare their strategies for the closing weeks, with an emphasis on making incendiary attacks on the Democrats … 'This is really not about messaging. It's not about persuasion in my race. It's more about getting the vote out,' Perdue said. … 'We think that Trump voters are going to continue to be very energized, and we don't think we'll have a problem with that,' Loeffler said. 'But the question is about the Democrat turnout. We don't know. We can't take for granted that we're going to keep everyone motivated.' … 'We've got to pile on big time,' Rove said on the call."
Russia failed to mount any major hacking or disinformation operations to interfere in the election.
U.S. officials say the Kremlin's hackers did not even attempt to target elections systems in the way they did in 2016, Ellen Nakashima reports: "Officials and analysts said it's too early to know why, but they point to a variety of possible reasons. Those include cyber and other operations that helped keep the Russians at bay, harder targets at the state and local level, and a political climate in which Americans themselves were the largest purveyors of disinformation, dwarfing Moscow's efforts to influence the campaign through social media and its propaganda channels. This year, U.S. Cyber Command pursued a new approach to countering Russian hackers who might want to disrupt the election. In a series of operations, the military attacked their systems and then fell back at random intervals to keep them off balance. Cybercom also attempted to sabotage Russian hacking tools."
Trump broods behind the scenes as his legal options dwindle.
"Despite mounting legal losses in courts and a retreat by his attorneys in a federal case filed against Pennsylvania election officials, Trump dug in on his false claim that he 'won' the election," Philip Rucker, Josh Dawsey, Gardner and Jon Swaine report. "Trump's campaign has begun winding down its operations, with employment contracts for a number of aides expiring on Sunday. The president, frustrated that his campaign lawyers were not appearing more frequently on television to amplify his baseless claim that he was the real election winner, has elevated attorneys Rudolph W. Giuliani and Jenna Ellis to run his legal and public-relations efforts to overturn the results. … Some of Trump's advisers have encouraged him to permit the Biden transition operation to officially begin its work … But the president — who is actively talking about running for president again in four years — has refused those entreaties, arguing that he thinks his core supporters want to see him 'keep fighting,' according to one of these advisers … 'He is more dug into his position than he was at the beginning,' this adviser said. … 'All of his people are despondent.' …
"In a meeting Friday, Giuliani told Trump that his advisers had been lying to him about his odds of prevailing and that he actually could win … Since then, Giuliani has taken over … 'It's really more of a public-relations fight now than a legal one,' one campaign official said. … Also further empowered is Ellis, who showed up at the campaign's headquarters over the weekend and signaled to others she would be taking a leading role in the effort. Ellis is viewed as an uncontrollable figure inside the campaign who often provided Trump with questionable information about alleged voter fraud and appeared on television without asking for approval from campaign officials … She recently dubbed herself 'President-Elect Jenna Ellis' on Twitter, which invited private derision from some of her colleagues. …
"Giuliani, Ellis and others, including Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell, have embraced more extreme conspiracy theories, including the debunked claim that Dominion Voting Systems … deleted Trump votes. Others on the campaign, such as deputy campaign manager Justin Clark, do not believe those theories … Trump has become personally obsessed with the baseless Dominion claims and has asked campaign officials as well as national security officials in the government about the company."
Three more lawyers representing Trump's campaign have asked to withdraw from his lawsuit attempting to block the certification of results in Pennsylvania, a case that legal experts describe as frivolous. "The lawyers - Linda Kerns, John Scott and Douglas Bryan Hughes - made the request in a court filing on Monday," Reuters reports. "The judge hearing the case allowed Scott and Hughes to withdraw but not Kerns. … The filing did not give a reason for the change, which came days after a prominent regional law firm, Porter Wright Morris & Arthur, also withdrew from the case." Harrisburg-based lawyer Marc Scaringi joined the Trump team and will be the president's lead counsel on the case. Just 10 days ago, Scaringi said there "really are no bombshells that are about to drop that will derail a Biden presidency, including these lawsuits."
Meanwhile, White House national security adviser Robert C. O'Brien acknowledged the obvious. "If the Biden-Harris ticket is determined to be the winner, and obviously things look that way now, we'll have a very professional transition from the National Security Council," O'Brien said at the Global Security Forum.

Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) said he would intervene if Biden was not receiving detailed intelligence briefings by Friday. Under blowback from the Trump defenders, the chairman of the committee that oversees the GSA backed off and claimed his comments were blown out of proportion. "I'm not in a hurry, necessarily, to get Joe Biden these briefings," Lankford told Newsmax, a pro-Trump site. (WSJ)

Only four other GOP senators – Mitt Romney (Utah), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Susan Collins (Maine) and Ben Sasse (Neb.) – have congratulated Biden. Rubio made the comment when asked by reporters what he would think of Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) as a possible director of national intelligence. "Well, that'll be the president-elect's decision obviously," Rubio said. (NPR)

The Trump presidencyHanding another win to the Taliban, Trump plans to slash troop levels in Afghanistan.
The White House is preparing to announce as soon as this week plans to roughly halve the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, from around 5,000 to 2,500, before the inauguration, Missy Ryan, Ellen Nakashima, Dan Lamothe, John Hudson and Karen DeYoung report. "The administration is also expected to announce a more modest troop reduction in Iraq, bringing the military force there from about 3,000 to 2,500 troops … But the reductions may not bring an end to America's long-running wars, as militant groups continue to evolve and fracture. The proposed cuts also have an uncertain meaning less than 70 days before Biden takes office and launches a process to scrutinize his predecessor's decisions. The Trump administration's decision to make a major reduction in Afghanistan, where violence has surged as Afghan negotiators engage in halting peace talks, in particular could bring to a head tensions that have intensified between some at the Pentagon and White House during a chaotic transition period. Officials cautioned that the plans from the White House, where foreign policy zigzags have been common, could change. Some aides are proposing a Trump speech later in the week to announce the planned cut from Afghanistan …
"Days before being dismissed, Pentagon chief Mark T. Esper sent Trump a classified memo that cautioned conditions were not adequate to make additional troop cuts in Afghanistan, citing the possibility of undermining peace talks and a variety of other factors. His assessment was based on input from senior military leaders. … [O'Brien] last month got into a public spat with Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about the course ahead in Afghanistan. At the time, Milley said that O'Brien's assertion that the troop level would be cut to 2,500 by January was 'speculation.' … O'Brien has told other officials that Milley isn't listening to the president on Afghanistan. …
"Reports about an imminent announcement prompted warnings from senior Republicans on Capitol Hill. In an impassioned speech Monday, [McConnell] implored the president not to end U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, saying it would be an embarrassment 'reminiscent of the humiliating American departure from Saigon in 1975.' McConnell, avoiding direct criticism of Trump, encouraged the president to preserve the 'limited, but important role' of those who remain. 'Leaving the field in Afghanistan to the Taliban and ISIS would be broadcast around the world as a symbol of U.S. defeat and humiliation,' he said. …
"Trump's plans have been only marginally coordinated, if at all, with his negotiating envoy to the Afghans, Zalmay Khalilzad, and with the Afghan government. While Trump has battled many of his top aides in his pursuit of a withdrawal, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has come to accept the president's wishes … 'If Taliban leaders 'can see they can win on the battlefield, then they don't need to make concessions at the negotiating table,' said Carter Malkasian, a former Pentagon official who took part in some of the talks U.S. officials have conducted with Taliban leaders in recent years."
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned this morning that premature withdrawal from Afghanistan could be dangerous. "The price for leaving too soon or in an uncoordinated way could be very high. Afghanistan risks becoming once again a platform for international terrorists to plan and organise attacks on our homelands. And ISIS could rebuild in Afghanistan the terror caliphate it lost in Syria and Iraq," Stoltenberg said in a statement this morning to CNN.
POTUS sought options last week for attacking Iran.
"Trump asked senior advisers in an Oval Office meeting on Thursday whether he had options to take action against Iran's main nuclear site in the coming weeks," the New York Times reports. "A range of senior advisers dissuaded the president from moving ahead with a military strike. The advisers — including Vice President Mike Pence; [Pompeo]; Christopher C. Miller, the acting defense secretary; and [Milley] — warned that a strike against Iran's facilities could easily escalate into a broader conflict in the last weeks of Mr. Trump's presidency. … Any strike — whether by missile or cyber — would almost certainly be focused on Natanz, where the International Atomic Energy Agency reported on Wednesday that Iran's uranium stockpile was now 12 times larger than permitted under the nuclear accord that Mr. Trump abandoned in 2018. …
"After Mr. Pompeo and General Milley described the potential risks of military escalation, officials left the meeting believing a missile attack inside Iran was off the table. … Mr. Trump might still be looking at ways to strike Iranian assets and allies, including militias in Iraq … Defense Department and other national security officials have privately expressed worries that the president might initiate operations, whether overt or secret, against Iran or other adversaries at the end of his term."
Trump is racing to auction off drilling rights in ANWR.
"The Trump administration is asking oil and gas firms to pick spots where they want to drill in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as it races to open the pristine wilderness to development and lock in drilling rights before Biden takes office," Juliet Eilperin reports. "The 'call for nominations' to be published Tuesday in the Federal Register allows companies to identify tracts on which to bid during an upcoming lease sale on the refuge's nearly 1.6 million-acre coastal plain … A GOP-controlled Congress in 2017 authorized drilling in the refuge, a vast wilderness that is home to tens of thousands of migrating caribou and waterfowl, along with polar bears and Arctic foxes. … The administration is pressing ahead with other moves to expand energy development and scale back federal environmental rules over the next few weeks. It aims to finalize a plan to open up the vast majority of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska to drilling, as well as adopt a narrower definition of what constitutes critical habitat for endangered species and when companies are liable for killing migratory birds. At the Energy Department, officials may weaken energy-efficiency requirements for shower heads, as well as washers and dryers before Inauguration Day. The government also plans to auction off oil and gas rights to more than 383,000 acres of federal land in the Lower 48 in the next two months."
A third GOP senator comes out against Trump’s Fed nominee, putting her confirmation on a knife’s edge.
"Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) on Monday said he would not support the nomination of Judy Shelton to the Federal Reserve's board of governors, narrowing the path for the controversial economist's confirmation in the final months of the Trump presidency," Rachel Siegel and Seung Min Kim report. "Alexander joins Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who said they would vote 'no' over the summer. … 'I am not convinced that she supports the independence of the Federal Reserve Board as much as I believe the Board of Governors should,' Alexander said in a statement … 'I don't want to turn over management of the money supply to a Congress and a President who can't balance the federal budget.'"
Jay Clayton, the SEC chairman, will step down at the end of the year.
"Clayton, a longtime corporate lawyer, was appointed by Trump in May 2017 and is one of the commission's longest-serving chairs," Hannah Denham reports. "During his tenure, Clayton emphasized protecting retail investors and drew praise for tackling complex market issues. The agency also cracked down on cryptocurrency scams, filing numerous cases over the past few years. But consumer advocates have said some of the SEC policies under his leadership could hurt consumers in the long run, including allowing more companies to raise money without traditional oversight."
More on the coronavirusCalifornia imposes its strictest restrictions since the spring.
"Governors and mayors moved rapidly on Monday to slow the galloping spread of covid-19," Griff Witte, Meryl Kornfield and Hannah Denham report. "In a mirror of the country's spring shutdown, California took some of the most dramatic steps, with Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) announcing he was pulling the state's 'emergency brake.' … The vast majority of the state — 94 percent of California's 40 million people — will now be living under the most restrictive stage of reopening, with indoor dining, fitness center workouts and religious services all suspended. … New Jersey and Philadelphia also announced new restrictions … The data explain why: The country racked up … at least 100,000 cases each day for nearly two weeks running. … The grim milestone of a quarter-million dead Americans is likely to be reached by the weekend. …
"The nation's current spike in infections — its third — is its most severe to date. With families and friends expected to gather for Thanksgiving next week, the spread of the novel coronavirus could easily worsen. But that is not inevitable, and experts say the measures announced Monday – if heeded – could have a pronounced impact in drawing down infections, just as they did in the spring. … Wide disparities in the rules remain, which could limit their effectiveness."

The World Health Organization tempers optimism about a vaccine.
"The world welcomed with relief biotechnology firm Moderna's announcement Monday that initial results suggested its coronavirus vaccine candidate was nearly 95 percent effective at preventing the illness. Markets soared on the promising news. But experts at the World Health Organization in Geneva weighed the hopes against a long slog they still see ahead," Adam Taylor reports. "Public health officials have long warned that the development of an effective vaccine would be the beginning of a struggle just as steep: an effort to vaccinate the world. … The caution at the world's top public health body was not directed toward the achievements of Moderna and other vaccine developers, but at creating a realistic understanding of the enormous task of immunization. Supply and delivery will pose high hurdles, among others, even if a vaccine is highly effective."
"Experts are frustrated that many of the lessons of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic have not been addressed, from ongoing investments in public health infrastructure to the use of transparent, fact-based communication strategies. Some of those insights have been neglected, some blatantly ignored, while other conundrums loom, unsolved, over the upcoming distribution of the coronavirus vaccines," Frances Stead Sellers reports.
"With no federal mandates to follow, an increasing number of U.S. airlines and airports are offering preflight coronavirus testing to boost public confidence in flying," Lori Aratani and Ian Duncan report. "More than 100 countries now require proof of a negative coronavirus test for entry, and in some cases travelers with negative results are allowed to skip otherwise mandatory quarantines."
Stanford distances itself from Scott Atlas.
Trump's controversial coronavirus adviser, a radiologist without public health experience, made headlines again over the weekend for encouraging Michigan residents to "rise up" against new restrictions unveiled by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D). Atlas is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank affiliated with the campus, but he is on leave to serve on Trump's task force. Without offering specifics, the university said in a statement that Atlas "has expressed views that are inconsistent with the university's approach in response to the pandemic" and his comments "reflect his personal views, not those of the Hoover Institution or the university."

A South Dakota nurse says many patients still deny the virus exists – even on their death beds.
"Jodi Doering, an emergency room nurse in South Dakota, was overwhelmed Saturday night. Her patients were dying of covid-19, yet were still in denial about the pandemic's existence. It's like a 'horror movie that never ends,' Doering wrote on Twitter," Paulina Villegas reports. "Her anxiety and despair is shared by many health-care workers who are facing a dramatic surge in … patients who, despite being severely ill, are reluctant to acknowledge that they have been infected with a virus that Trump has said will simply disappear. Doering said she has covid-19 patients who need 100 percent-oxygen breathing assistance who will also swear that they don't have the illness … 'Their last dying words are, 'This can't be happening. It's not real,'' Doering said, adding that some patients prefer to believe that they have pneumonia or other diseases rather than covid-19, despite seeing their positive test results."
Some places were short on nurses before the virus. The pandemic is making it worse.
"There is record demand for travel nurses, who take out-of-town assignments on short-term contracts of 13 weeks or less at elevated wages. Per-diem nurses, who are willing to take a shift or two in their local hospitals, have been pressed into service. The military is chipping in. And still, in some places, it is not nearly enough," Lenny Bernstein reports. "Staffing in U.S. hospitals, particularly among nurses, has reflected a patchwork of local shortages in recent years … But now, the once-in-a-century pandemic is exposing the liabilities of this just-in-time, cost-conscious approach at some hospitals, chronic staff shortages in others and the toll of the pandemic on an exhausted workforce."

President-elect Joe Biden is expected to dramatically shift how the government handles cybersecurity threats when he takes office in January.
Those changes probably will include a top-level focus on election security after the White House virtually ignored the topic for the past four years and a far tougher stance on Russian hacking and disinformation campaigns than President Trump, who was often unwilling to publicly criticize Russia and President Vladimir Putin.
"There are members of the Trump administration that prioritized cybersecurity, but Trump never has – and that will be different with Biden," said Chris Painter, who served as the State Department's top cybersecurity official during the Obama administration and for the first few months of the Trump administration. Trump frequently misstated basic facts about cybersecurity and seldom mentioned the topic publicly.
Here are five key cybersecurity priorities for the Biden administration.
1. Seeking more funding for election security – which Republicans could start seeing as politically beneficial.
Democrats' effort to deliver billions of dollars to make elections more secure against hacking and safer during the pandemic were stymied during the past four years by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other Republicans who seemed to fear sparking Trump's ire. The president seemed to view discussions about election security as delegitimizing his unexpected 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton and later spread unfounded rumors about widespread mail voting fraud.
Republicans agreed to deliver more than $1 billion for election security and safety during the Trump administration, but that was only about one-fourth of what Democrats sought.
Trump leaving office could clear the way for a far bigger package to fund a shift to paper ballots in states and counties that still lack them, increased mail voting and more post-election audits to ensure votes were counted accurately.
The political winds may be changing now: Republicans may also feel new pressure to invest in auditable paper trails and other measures to ensure voting integrity because of Trump's unfounded claims of voting fraud, which he's continued to make after the election.
Trump, who hasn't conceded the election, is claiming voting irregularities in numerous states where Biden is leading or has been declared the winner but so far hasn't had much luck on the legal front.
Either way, "I don't think that's an issue a Democratic administration could ignore," Neil Jenkins, a former DHS official who worked on election security during the Obama and Trump administrations, told me. "Election security and infrastructure has been so high on the radar the last four years."
Notably, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris was also a major booster of election security and a sponsor or co-sponsor of most of the major election security bills in the Senate.
But Republicans are unlikely to budge in their opposition to Democratic efforts to mandate that states and counties that receive federal money for elections follow specific cybersecurity standards. That means the only chance of advancing Democrats' boldest election security plans probably will depend on them winning January runoff elections for two Senate seats in Georgia that will determine which party controls the Senate.
Democrats say mandates are important because hackers will attack the least-defended election infrastructure and a breach anywhere can drive down confidence about an election. But Republicans have said such standards amount to a federal takeover of elections. They also say mandates are largely unnecessary because election officials have generally followed expert advice about cybersecurity without being forced to.
"If we have a Democratic president and House and Senate, I believe we'll certainly see a major bill put forward on election security and there are certainly going to be minimum requirements and standards if states take advantage of that money," Rep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.), co-founder of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, told me before the election. "It's not going to be heavy-handed, but they'll have to have paper ballots and audit trails and that sort of thing."
2. Getting tougher on Russia.
Biden warned during the campaign that Russia would face serious consequences if it interfered with election infrastructure – a big shift from Trump, who repeatedly wavered on whether Russia interfered in the 2016 election and seemed to take Putin's word on the issue over the conclusion of his own intelligence agencies.
"With Russia, Trump hasn't confronted them, so they've just steamrolled over us," Jim Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told me.
Under Biden, experts expect to see consistent public warnings from the White House that Russia needs to steer clear of hacking a whole range of critical U.S. sectors, including elections, financial services and energy companies. They're also looking for the United States to impose consequences if Russia does attack those sectors, including sanctions, indictments and retaliatory cyberstrikes.
"One of the major flaws in the Trump administration has been inconsistent messaging around Russia," Painter said. "No matter what the government does to challenge an adversary, it will be torn apart if the leader is undercutting that message, and the adversary will be emboldened."
Yet Biden has already gotten into some hot water with security experts by publicly blaming the Kremlin for helping orchestrate the release of unverified emails to the New York Post aimed at embarrassing him and his son Hunter. However, intelligence agencies have not concluded that Russia was behind the release. Biden based his claim largely on a letter from former national security officials who said the emails had the "hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign" but had no specific evidence of a plot – a standard that's too low, experts say.
"Biden is holding himself to a higher standard than Trump. Then we should hold Biden to a higher standard as well," Thomas Rid, professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University, told our colleagues after the presidential debate. "And that means acknowledging in this case that we just don't have the evidence."
3. Making a clear case against China.
If there's one issue where cybersecurity experts expect continuity between the Trump and Biden administrations, it's China.
The Biden administration probably will continue Trump policies banning the Chinese telecom Huawei from building U.S. 5G networks and barring other Chinese companies from industry sectors where they might be able to steal critical data or damage U.S. national security.
"The general direction of China policy will remain the same," Lewis told me. "There's no space for any letting up."
But Biden administration officials probably will try to make a clearer and more consistent argument about why Chinese technology poses cybersecurity concerns, which could help convince allies that are on the fence about imposing their own bans.
Trump officials had mixed success convincing allies to ban Huawei from their 5G networks, partly because they were often undercut by the president, who signaled he might reverse the ban as part of a U.S.-China trade deal.
4. Filling more top cybersecurity posts in government.
Trump administration officials eliminated two of the most prominent cybersecurity posts in government — a White House czar who was responsible for coordinating cybersecurity issues across the government and a State Department coordinator who acted as the nation's top cybersecurity diplomat.
The State Department cybersecurity job was later integrated into the responsibilities of another official focused on global Internet governance.
Those moves were panned even by many Republicans and a bipartisan congressionally led cybersecurity commission recommended reinstating both of them.
That's likely to happen during a Biden administration, experts told me.
There may also be a push to expand the term of the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which leads the government's domestic election security efforts, so it's more insulated from a president's political whims. Reps. John Katko (R-N.Y.) and Jim Langevin (D-R.I.) introduced a bill this year that would give the CISA director a five-year term.
5. More cybersecurity help for states.
Another issue where Republicans and Democrats might be able to compromise is on delivering money to help state and local governments improve their cybersecurity protections.
That money could be essential to combating a wave of ransomware attacks that have hit state and local governments in recent years as well as hospitals and schools. Ransomware attacks seize and encrypt a victim's computer files until the victim pays a ransom that can reach into the millions of dollars.
The House passed a bipartisan bill in September that would have delivered $400 million in cybersecurity aid to state and local governments to help protect against such hacks, but it hasn't made progress in the Senate. A similar effort might go further next year if lawmakers are looking for an easy bipartisan win.
"Cybersecurity has fortunately managed to stay a largely bipartisan issue, and that helps," Suzanne Spaulding, who led the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity efforts during the Obama administration, told me.
The keysRepublican claims of voting irregularities aren’t withstanding legal scrutiny.
Judges in states where Biden leads in the vote count have said that Republicans didn't provide enough evidence to back their claims of voting irregularities — just speculation, rumors or hearsay, David A. Fahrenthold, Elise Viebeck, Emma Brown and Rosalind S. Helderman report.
In Michigan, Republicans lost two lawsuits alleging impropriety in ballot counts because they were unable to provide evidence of wrongdoing. In one case the Trump campaign cited a sticky note from an unnamed poll worker alleging late-arriving ballots were being counted improperly. The judge dismissed the note as hearsay.
In Arizona, the Trump campaign pushed a lawsuit based on an unfounded claim that votes went uncounted because voters were given Sharpie pens to fill out ballots. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs (D) accused the campaign of using the courts to delay the count.
Similar scenarios have played out in Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. The lawsuits have focused on smaller claims that would probably affect a small fraction of voters, rather than allegations of widespread fraud that have blanketed Trump's Twitter page.
Trump's allies also don't appear to be slowing down. Trump's personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani said the campaign would file a case in federal court in Pennsylvania as well as in other unspecified states.
"Many cases are going to be filed — some big, some small. This is going to be eventually a big case," he said Saturday in Philadelphia.
Trump and allies continue to push disinformation after Twitter and Facebook confirm Biden's victory.
The Trump campaign's director of communications, Tim Murtaugh, tweeted a doctored photo of a 2000 Washington Times front page that was altered to make it look like the paper had run a headline announcing "President Gore" after that tight election.
Murtaugh has since deleted the tweet, Felicia Sonmez reported.
The Washington Times tweeted that it contacted Murtaugh about the error.
Trump also continues to tweet unfounded claims alleging voter fraud.
Twitter policies about shielding some of those claims from view and blocking retweeting of them has shifted since the election was called for Biden.
Twitter did not put a gray box over a Trump tweet on Saturday that claimed without evidence that election observers weren't allowed into counting rooms, Tony Romm reported.Instead it added a label on the tweet, saying "This claim about election fraud is disputed." The company also did not limit sharing of that tweet.
Election officials ramped up security measures and police presence to deal with angry Trump supporters.
In cities including Las Vegas, Detroit, Phoenix and Atlanta, protesters yelled and banged on windows to be let in to monitor poll workers, Amy Gardner, Reis Thebault, Hannah Knowles and Michelle Ye Hee Lee reported. Unruly challengers in Detroit were ejected from watching poll workers.
The surge of distrust was egged on by Trump's surrogates and online misinformation. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel spread false claims that 2,000 Michigan ballots that included votes for Republican were recorded as Democratic votes. Although the actual issue was a technical glitch that was immediately fixed, McDaniel's claims quickly spread across the Internet.
One Fulton County, Ga., poll worker had his personal information posted online after a viral video accused him of throwing away a ballot.
Even with Biden declared the winner, election officials are facing a lengthy process to audit and verify vote totals.

Full text: with Mariana Alfaro
In 2016, for the first time since America ratified the 17th Amendment in 1913 and began directly electing senators, whichever party carried a state in the presidential race also won the Senate contest there. Politics has been growing increasingly nationalized for decades, but President Trump supercharged these trends and accelerated a once-in-a-generation realignment. Sen. Doug Jones is almost certain to lose because he is a Democrat in Alabama while Sen. Susan Collins trails in the polls because she is a Republican in Maine, and many GOP strategists have written off Sen. Cory Gardner because he is a Republican in Colorado.
In other words, whether Republicans maintain Senate control is inextricably linked to how Trump fares 13 days from now. A fresh Washington Post-ABC News poll from North Carolina illustrates this: Republican Sen. Thom Tillis and Democrat Cal Cunningham are locked in a toss-up race. Revelations of illicit texts and an extramarital affair with a political consultant do not appear to have meaningfully hurt Cunningham because voters say they care more about which party controls the Senate and the incumbent's support for Trump than the challenger's moral character.
Cunningham's 49 percent support among likely voters is identical to that of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. In our poll, 92 percent of Biden supporters back Cunningham and 92 percent of Trump supporters back Tillis. Nearly 9 in 10 Democrats and Republicans in the Tar Heel State say that control of the Senate is "extremely" or "very" important in their vote.
There is less ticket-splitting now than in any era since Reconstruction. Collins, a moderate Republican, won reelection six years ago with 69 percent of the vote, two years after Barack Obama garnered 56 percent in Maine. But then Trump came down the golden escalator, and she cast a pivotal vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court after Christine Blasey Ford's testimony that the judge sexually assaulted her when they were both teenagers. Kavanaugh vigorously denied this.
Many prominent Republicans have privately become more pessimistic about their hopes of holding the Senate in two weeks because Trump is currently faring worse than they had expected in states with competitive Senate races, from Arizona to Iowa and Georgia. It is also why GOP strategists are feeling confident that competitive races will break their way in red states that Trump is poised to carry, including Montana, South Carolina, Kansas, Alaska and Texas, even as Democrats wage well-funded campaigns.
On the other hand, Democrats feel hopeful that Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) will survive what polls show is a toss-up race with GOP challenger John James so long as Biden wins Michigan. But Democratic strategists say that Peters, who is not well known and has run a lackluster campaign, will probably lose reelection if Trump finds a way to pull out a repeat victory in the Wolverine State.
Republicans hold a 53-to-47 seat majority. Democrats need to pick up a net four seats to seize control of the upper chamber. If Biden wins, they need to gain three because a Vice President Kamala Harris could cast a tie-breaking vote.
Historically, with the political atmosphere the way it is, it would be expected that GOP incumbents would be trying to distance themselves from Trump. But most Republican senators in tough races have been nervous to publicly break with the president because they recognize how closely their fortunes are tied together. They are fearful of being on the receiving end of the kind of Trump tweetstorm that greeted Collins last week over her opposition to confirming Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.
Strikingly, Trump has devoted more tweets recently to attacking Republican senators who crossed him, such as Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.), than their Democratic challengers. This is consistent with the president's long-held belief that it is better to be feared than loved. It has been central to his governing style, and it has more often than not worked for him vis-a-vis Capitol Hill.
The fact that more Senate Republicans have not distanced themselves from Trump helps explain why the president is so convinced that he could prod them to vote for a coronavirus relief deal and stomach whatever concerns they might have about a $2 trillion package still being negotiated with Democrats by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
"Prospects for an economic relief package in the next two weeks dimmed markedly on Tuesday after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) revealed that he has warned the White House not to strike an agreement with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi before the Nov. 3 election," Jeff Stein and Erica Werner report. "Republicans have voiced concerns that a stimulus deal could splinter the party and exacerbate divisions at a time when they are trying to rally behind the Supreme Court nominee. … Trump has in recent days downplayed or dismissed conservative opposition to spending trillions more on a stimulus, saying he wants to spend even more money than Pelosi's latest $2.2 trillion proposal. Many Republicans had already balked at spending more than $1 trillion on this round of relief."
But Trump was dismissive when he was asked Tuesday about McConnell's resistance to calling a vote on a package so big. "He'll be onboard if something comes," the president said on Fox News. "Not every Republican agrees with me, but they will."
The coronavirusUnprecedented vaccine trials are on track to begin delivering results.
"In a matter of weeks, one of the most closely watched human experiments in history will start to report early results, with data on prospective coronavirus vaccines possibly coming this month or in November from the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and the biotechnology company Moderna," Carolyn Johnson reports. "Amid the turmoil, chaos and misinformation that have defined the U.S. response to the pandemic, progress toward a vaccine, or vaccines, has been steady, reassuring and scientific. Political meddling has so far been largely deflected. Drug companies, working closely with the U.S. government and fueled by an infusion of more than $10 billion of taxpayer money, have developed, tested and scaled up a half-dozen potential vaccines at unprecedented speed. And on Thursday, independent advisers to the Food and Drug Administration will convene their first full-day meeting to lay the groundwork for their coming consequential deliberations on whether to recommend specific vaccines for public use. Those votes are not binding, but the FDA typically follows the recommendations of its advisory committees."

The pandemic has left 299,000 more people dead in the U.S. than would be expected in a typical year.
The CDC says two-thirds of them are from covid-19 and the rest are from other causes. New federal data show the virus has taken a disproportionate toll on Latinos and Blacks, as we've written about extensively, but researchers also found, more surprisingly, that the contagion has struck 25- to 44-year-olds very hard. "Their 'excess death' rate is up 26.5  percent over previous years, the largest change for any age group. It is not clear whether that spike is caused by the shift in covid-19 deaths toward younger people between May and August or deaths from other causes," Lenny Bernstein reports."The United States is in the midst of another sharp increase in coronavirus infections, this one centered in the upper Midwest and Plains states. The seven-day rolling average of cases, considered the most accurate barometer, is near 60,000 per day. At least 220,000 people have died of covid-19 so far … (Experts say) the total is likely to reach 400,000 by the end of the year."
The opioid crisis is getting worse, but drug overdoses are overshadowed by the pandemic.
"After a one-year drop in 2018, U.S. opioid overdose deaths increased again in 2019, topping 50,000 for the first time," the AP reports, citing CDC data. "That accounted for the majority of the 71,000 fatal overdoses from all drugs. … Ohio, a battleground state in the presidential contest, is on track to have one of its deadliest years of opioid drug overdoses. More residents died of overdoses in May than in any month in at least 14 years … During Trump's first two years in office, 48 of the 59 Ohio counties with reliable data saw their overdose death rates get worse …
"What that looks like on the ground is mothers donating to GoFundMe accounts and Facebook campaigns so other mothers can bury their children who've overdosed. Some parents even reserve a casket while their child is still alive so they are prepared for what they believe is inevitable. Others become legal guardians of their grandchildren."
DHS, which led the way in past health crises, has been far less visible.
"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has a history of helping to lead the U.S. response to public-health threats such as swine flu and Ebola, standing with the nation's top medical experts to emphasize that the threat to the nation is severe. But during the months-long coronavirus pandemic that has affected much of American society, one of the country's largest federal agencies has instead publicly promoted immigrants, anarchists and smugglers as more dangerous to the United States than a virus," Maria Sacchetti reports. Acting Secretary Chad Wolf rarely mentions the coronavirus on Twitter. He and his deputies routinely peel off their masks during public events to speak to indoor audiences. "I don't know what role, if any, DHS is playing," said Janet Napolitano, President Barack Obama's first DHS secretary and a former governor of Arizona. "They're kind of MIA."

Quote of the day
"Before the plague came in, I had it made," Trump said Tuesday at a rally in Erie, Pa., referring to the coronavirus. "I wasn't coming to Erie. I have to be honest. There was no way I was coming. I didn't have to."

The electionBiden's campaign has three times as much cash on hand as Trump's.
"Biden's campaign committee entered October with an estimated $180 million compared with Trump's $63 million, according to federal filings made public Tuesday night — a dramatic reversal in financial resources that unfolded in recent months as Democratic donors in September poured a record amount of money into supporting Biden," Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Anu Narayanswamy report. "An increasing number of donors have met the maximum amount they can contribute to the Trump campaign, and the campaign in recent months has maintained a virtual fundraising schedule that has been less aggressive than Biden's. … At least 31.4million people nationwide have already voted in the general election, with at least 15.8million of those in battleground states … The Biden campaign recently told its donors that it is projecting to raise $234million more before Election Day, but it urged supporters not to take the fundraising for granted."
Tensions run high at early-voting sites.
"The first days of early voting have unfolded with dozens of accusations of inappropriate campaigning and possible voter intimidation in at least 14 states," Joshua Partlow reports. "At one polling place at a church in Hendersonville, Tenn., last week, a Trump supporter drove by repeatedly in a large truck-and-trailer rig with Trump flags and music blaring from speakers, 'creating a lot of havoc,' said Lori Ashley, the administrator of elections for Sumner County. … In Albuquerque, a convoy of vehicles, some with Trump flags, honked and yelled near a voting site on Saturday, the first day of early voting, according to a video submitted to news station KRQE. … Inside a polling place in the Coral Ridge Mall in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a group of people not wearing masks got into a shouting match Monday with others nearby, according to Stephanie Lillo, 30, a voter who witnessed the disturbance."
"Authorities in Florida and Alaska on Tuesday were investigating threatening emails sent to Democratic voters that claimed to be from the Proud Boys, a far-right group supportive of Trump, but appeared instead to be a deceptive campaign making use of a vulnerability in the organization's online network," Isaac Stanley-Becker and Craig Timberg report.

After the 2016 election, our opinion desk asked readers to share why they voted for Trump.
They checked back in with voters whose responses they published four years ago to find out whether the president could count on their support again. Here is what they had to say: "In 2016 … I held my nose and voted for Donald Trump. This time, I won't be holding my nose," said Jay Maynard, 60, of Fairmont, Minn. "However much or little you ascribe blame for the current restlessness of the country to Trump, he's definitely not the solution," said Max Mordell, 34, of Cincinnati. "It's easy to say, 'I'm a conservative,' and vote that way when the person I supported was humble and thoughtful. … These times are not those," said Lesley Newman, 57, of Scottsdale, Ariz.
"All of the mindless chatter about his tweets and political incorrectness is childish and ridiculous," said Phil McNeish, 61, of Roanoke, Va. "I'm still glad the Clintons are not in the White House, but I will be voting for Biden in November," said Howard Gaskill, 80, of Georgetown, Del. "They have not given me any reason to vote for Biden except that Trump is bad. And that's not enough," said Shoanna Crowell, 49, of Boston.
Angry at Lesley Stahl, Trump threatened to preemptively release their interview.
"Trump lashed out at '60 Minutes' host Lesley Stahl and threatened to release their interview after he cut off their conversation at the White House on Tuesday because he didn't like the aggressive tone of her questions," Josh Dawsey, Colby Itkowitz and Jeremy Barr report."The president posted a short clip of a maskless Stahl speaking to two mask-wearing men and wrote, 'Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes not wearing a mask in the White House after her interview with me. Much more to come.' A little more than an hour later, Trump threatened to post their interview before the news program is scheduled to air it Sunday night on CBS News. … Trump and Pence were meant to do the signature walk-and-talk portion of the '60Minutes' interview together, but after cutting off his sit-down with Stahl, the president did not return for that segment. A person at CBS familiar with the interview said the footage of Stahl without a mask that Trump tweeted was taken 'immediately following the interview with the CBS team,' all of whom had been tested …
"According to a person with knowledge of what happened during the interview, Trump was unhappy that Stahl asked him tough questions regarding his rhetoric about Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) and his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the size of the crowds at his rallies and his disputes with Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's leading infectious-disease expert. Stahl also told him during the interview that allegations about Biden's son Hunter were not verified and that the Obama administration did not spy on the Trump campaign. Many of the questions were about the coronavirus pandemic and his handling of it … Three aides, who were not authorized to speak publicly, said the president overreacted, and one suggested that he might actually boost the ratings of a tough interview. A senior White House official said Trump had told aides he wanted to go after Stahl and brainstormed ideas after the session with a group of aides in the Oval Office."
Trump and Biden are preparing very differently for their final debate.
"Biden is keeping an unusually light public schedule. In the past four days, he has traveled outside his home state of Delaware just once, to North Carolina on Sunday," " Amy Wang, Sean Sullivan and Dawsey report. "Biden's surrogates have kept a robust travel schedule in his place: Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), his running mate, campaigned in Florida on Monday, and [Obama] is scheduled to hold his first public event for Biden in Philadelphia on Wednesday. … Trump has not undertaken the same kind of formal preparation as before the first debate …
"Trump wants and plans to bring up Hunter Biden during the debate, though some of his advisers would prefer that he focus on the economy and Joe Biden's record … Biden's advisers, for their part, see little to be gained by engaging publicly in the details of Hunter Biden's alleged emails and texts beyond what they have already said … But ignoring the matter altogether is not an option either, … leaving some uncertainty about how Biden will address it Thursday night."
The FBI notified Congress last night that it has "nothing to add at this time" to a statement made by Trump's director of national intelligence disputing the idea that Russia orchestrated the discovery of a computer that may have belonged to Hunter Biden. "FBI Assistant Director Jill C. Tyson sent the letter to Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), a Trump ally and chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, in response to his demand for more information about the computer following a series of reports by the New York Post," Devlin Barrett reports."Appearing Monday on Fox Business Channel, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said 'there is no intelligence that supports' the idea that the purported Hunter Biden laptop and the emails on it 'are part of a Russian disinformation campaign.' The letter notes that the FBI faced a severe backlash for its handling of the 2016 investigations surrounding then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and makes clear it is seeking to avoid the kind of criticism heaped upon it by the Justice Department's inspector general, among others, for the FBI's decision to notify Congress less than two weeks before Election Day that it had reopened an investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server."
Swing states that may decide the election are vulnerable to USPS slowdowns.
"Consistent and timely delivery remains scattershot as the agency struggles to right operations after the rollout, then suspension, of a major midsummer restructuring. In 17 postal districts representing 10 battleground states and 151 electoral votes, first-class mail is on time 83.9 percent; that's 7.8 percentage points lower than January and nearly 2 percentage points below the national average. By that measure, more than 1 in 6 mailings arrive outside the agency's one- to three-day delivery window," Jacob Bogage and Christopher Ingraham report. "The slowdowns, which have raised alarms and suspicions among voters, postal workers and voting experts, have particular implications for states with strict voter deadlines. Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia, for example, do not accept ballots that arrive after Election Day regardless of postmark. Of the states that do, there is generally a short qualifying window: In North Carolina, where polls have Trump and Biden in a dead heat, postmarked ballots must arrive within three days of the election. …
"In Detroit, where Democrats are relying on heavy turnout to carry the rest of Michigan, only 70.9 percent of first-class mail was on time the week that ended Oct. 9, compared with 92.2 percent at the start of the year. In Wisconsin — which struggled mightily with a vote-by-mail primary in August — on-time delivery fell to 84.3 percent in the Lakeland district, which encompasses most of the state. … Timeliness also varied widely in postal districts in Pennsylvania and Florida. … Some postal workers say ballot-handling directives from higher-ups have been chaotic. Letter carriers in Michigan say supervisors press them to focus on package delivery toward the end of their shifts, leaving ballot collection lower on the priority list. In Pennsylvania, clerks are preparing to handstamp ballot envelopes in the final stretch of the 2020 campaign, to steer them away from overwhelmed processing plants."
The Trump presidencyMore than 500 children have lost their parents because of Trump's family-separation policy.
"Lawyers appointed by a federal judge to identify migrant families who were separated by the Trump administration say that they have yet to track down the parents of 545 children and that about two-thirds of those parents were deported to Central America without their children, according to a filing Tuesday from the American Civil Liberties Union," NBC News reports. "The Trump administration instituted a 'zero tolerance' policy in 2018 that separated migrant children and parents at the southern U.S. border. The administration later confirmed that it had actually begun separating families in 2017 along some parts of the border under a pilot program."
Trump paid more in taxes to the Chinese government than income tax in the United States.
"Trump and his allies have tried to paint [Biden] as soft on China, in part by pointing to his son's business dealings there," the New York Times reports. "But Mr. Trump's own business history is filled with overseas financial deals, and some have involved the Chinese state. He spent a decade unsuccessfully pursuing projects in China, operating an office there during his first run for president and forging a partnership with a major government-controlled company. And it turns out that China is one of only three foreign nations — the others are Britain and Ireland — where Mr. Trump maintains a bank account … The foreign accounts do not show up on Mr. Trump's public financial disclosures, where he must list personal assets, because they are held under corporate names. … The Chinese account is controlled by Trump International Hotels Management L.L.C., which the tax records show paid $188,561 in taxes in China while pursuing licensing deals there from 2013 to 2015. … Until last year, China's biggest state-controlled bank rented three floors in Trump Tower, a lucrative lease that drew accusations of a conflict of interest for the president."
Trump's lawyers continue to delay complying with a congressional subpoena for the tax returns. "Douglas Letter, general counsel for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), said Trump 'has refused to cooperate at all, unlike all of the modern prior presidents. That is why we are here.' He urged the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to act before the start of a new Congress in January to enforce the subpoena for the president's records," Ann Marimow reports.
A major Trump fundraiser pleads guilty to acting as an unregistered foreign agent for China.
"Elliott Broidy pleaded guilty Tuesday to acting as an unregistered foreign agent, admitting to accepting millions of dollars to secretly lobby the Trump administration for Malaysian and Chinese interests," Spencer Hsu reports. "In a plea deal, Broidy, who helped raise millions for President Trump's campaign before serving as the Republican National Committee's national deputy finance chair, agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for a recommendation of leniency at sentencing and to forfeit $6.6 million. Justice Department officials called Broidy and his co-conspirators' secret work on behalf of the ringleader of a Malaysian government scandal and a Chinese security official a case study of foreign governments' efforts to influence U.S. policy while hiding behind politically influential proxies. … Broidy acknowledged working for the benefit of a senior Chinese security minister to return outspoken Chinese exile Guo Wengui to his home country from the United States, prosecutors said."
Senior government officials are suspect of Trump's motives in pushing to fast-track a 5G contract.
"Senior officials throughout various departments and agencies of the Trump administration tell CNN they are alarmed at White House pressure to grant what would essentially be a no-bid contract to lease the Department of Defense's mid-band spectrum – premium real estate for the booming and lucrative 5G market – to Rivada Networks, a company in which prominent Republicans and supporters of Trump have investments," Jake Tapper reports. "The pressure campaign to fast track Rivada's 'Request for Proposal' by using authorities that would preclude a competitive bidding process intensified in September, and has been led by White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who was acting at Trump's behest … Trump was encouraged to help Rivada by Fox News commentator and veteran GOP strategist Karl Rove, a lobbyist for, and investor in, Rivada. Untold billions are at stake. A government auction of 70 megahertz of spectrum in August went for more than $4.5 billion. The Rivada bid would be for 350 megahertz of spectrum -- five times that amount. … Rove denied to CNN that Rivada is seeking an RFP or any non-competitive process. …
"Denials notwithstanding, informed sources (say) that the White House is unquestionably pressuring the Pentagon to approve what would likely be, in the words of one senior administration official, 'the biggest handoff of economic power to a single entity in history,' and to do so without full examination of the impact on national security and without a competitive bidding process. Craig Moffett, a highly regarded Wall Street analyst of the telecommunications sector, concluded in a October 7 research paper: 'The whole story smacks of cronyism at best and reeks of 'the swamp' at worst.' …
"Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, has been arguing against anything but free market competition … For years, Trump seemingly agreed with Kudlow. Yet something changed come election time … and the President began pushing Meadows to help Rivada. Informed sources speculate that Trump may have been trying to curry favor with Rove, who has never been a reliable member of the MAGA team but remains a powerful fundraising force and strategist in GOP politics. … FCC officials have also been stunned at the White House's push, both at its attempt to do this using other agencies instead of their independent commission, and the attempt to do so without respecting the normal independent bidding process."
Trump’s DOJ sued Google, but it’s the government’s power to police big tech that will be on trial.
"The Justice Department on Tuesday alleged that Google engaged in unlawful, anticompetitive tactics to grow its search and advertising empires into dominant digital forces, enriching itself and amassing unrivaled market share that makes it impossible for smaller companies to compete and thrive," Tony Romm reports. "At stake is no less than Washington's power and political willingness to watch over Silicon Valley, so the government's gambit against Google stands to test whether roughly century-old antitrust rules are sufficiently powerful to keep the country's technology giants in check. On Capitol Hill, some lawmakers quickly seized on the government's antitrust action to call again for Congress to rein in big tech companies."
A top Trump political appointee at the State Department allegedly drank alcohol excessively on the job.
"A high-ranking State Department official who is close to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo drank alcohol excessively on 'numerous' occasions while working, even raising a red flag among foreign counterparts, multiple State Department officials told the agency's watchdog for an unpublished report," HuffPost reports. "The investigation was concluded in May and submitted to Pompeo's team, but it is not expected to be officially released. It largely addresses a period between the fall of 2017 and the summer of 2019, when Cam Henderson served in a less senior role. Last August, Henderson became the chief of protocol, an important post that oversees delicate diplomatic events and matters of rank. The revelation about her behavior and apparent impunity adds to the impression that the State Department has become less professional and more politicized under [Trump]. …
"Two department officials also described alcohol-related issues with Henderson to The Washington Post for an August story. … Pompeo tapped Henderson to succeed Sean Lawler without seeking Senate confirmation, breaking with normal practice. Henderson has been deeply involved in Pompeo's controversial practice of holding 'Madison dinners,' swanky taxpayer-funded events featuring the secretary and his wife that some lawmakers and officials at the State Department view as politically motivated ― more about Pompeo's future presidential ambitions than any diplomatic purpose. … Henderson is a longtime GOP operative who worked for years with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie … A State Department spokesperson strongly defended Henderson and attacked the inspector general … No part of the State Department's response directly refuted the idea that Henderson regularly drank to excess on the job."

Anthony Tata did not have the votes necessary to get confirmed by the GOP-controlled Senate as President Trump's undersecretary of defense for policy, the third-highest civilian post at the Pentagon. On Thursday, Republicans on the Senate Armed Services Committee canceled his confirmation hearing 90 minutes before it was scheduled to begin. On Sunday night, the Pentagon announced that Tata has withdrawn and, instead, has been "designated as the official performing the duties of the deputy undersecretary of defense for policy." That circumvents Congress.
"Tata's nomination was controversial following statements he made that included calling former president Barack Obama a 'terrorist leader,' suggesting that former CIA director John Brennan should prepare for execution or suck 'on a pistol,' and saying that Islam is the 'most oppressive violent religion I know of,'" Dan Lamothe reports. "Tata retired as a brigadier general in 2009 under a cloud after the Army inspector general found that he had at least two extramarital affairs, despite adultery being a crime in the military."
Contrary to the president's claims, Article II does not give him the power to do whatever he wants. A hallmark of Trump's tenure has been his disdain for the "advice and consent" function given to the Senate for appointments by Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. Alexander Hamilton argued in Federalist 76 that requiring the Senate to confirm a president's pick for important jobs was a critical "check" on the executive branch "to prevent the appointment of unfit characters."
Trump has said he loves keeping people in "acting" positions, including in the Cabinet. It also circumvents congressional oversight. The president has installed loyalists and ideologues into critical positions when it was clear they could not get confirmed by the GOP-controlled Senate for the job, such as former acting director of national intelligence Ric Grenell.
The president's use of what's known as delegation authority has received less attention, but it is perhaps more of an affront to the constitutional principle of advice and consent. There is not a limit on how long Tata could hold his new job, for example. Trump has had a deputy director exercising the authority of director for the National Park Service, a senior official performing the duties of the director at Immigration and Customs Enforcement and so on. The administration has done this across the government. The higher-level position goes unfilled so that someone in a position that is not Senate-confirmed can call the shots.
A federal judge ruled in March that Trump's appointment last year of Ken Cuccinelli to be head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services was a violation of federal vacancy laws, and that Cuccinelli lacked the authority to issue policy directives tightening asylum rules. "In his ruling, Judge Moss referred to a long-running gag on The Office, the classic sitcom about bureaucratic absurdity, about the difference between 'assistant regional manager' and 'assistant to the regional manager,'" NPR noted at the time.
Two weeks ago, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D) filed a lawsuit challenging the authority of the acting director of the Bureau of Land Management, William Perry Pendley. Bullock, who is running for Senate, asks a judge for an junction to oust Pendley, who has essentially run the agency for more than a year, on the grounds that he cannot work as acting director now that he's been formally nominated for the job.
Tata has served since this spring as a senior adviser to Defense Secretary Mark Esper in an unconfirmed capacity. The Pentagon said in its Sunday night statement that Tata "looks forward to continuing to help implement the President's National Security agenda."
Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.), the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, complained that vacant positions at the Defense Department are at a record high, which he described as a "threat" to national security. "If an appointee cannot gain the support of the Senate, as is clearly the case with Tata, then the president should not put that person into an identical temporary role," said Smith. "This evasion of scrutiny makes our government less accountable and prioritizes loyalty over competence."
Sen. Jack Reed (R.I.), the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, condemned the appointment of Tata as " an offensive, destabilizing move," and called on his Republican colleagues to demand the White House remove Tata from his new post. "If President Trump's goal is to hollow out, politicize, and undermine the Pentagon the way he has the State Department and Intelligence Community, then mission accomplished," Reed said in a statement. "This method of appointment is an insult to our troops, professionals at the Pentagon, the Senate, and the American people.Clearly, President Trump wants people who will swear allegiance to him over the Constitution.… The American people must not grow numb to the dizzying dysfunction of this Administration and the Senate should not allow moves like this to go unchecked."
Trump had pressed Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, to give Tata a hearing. Inhofe said in a statement last week that he had told Trump by phone on Wednesday night that "it wouldn't serve any useful purpose to have a hearing at this point" and that Trump had agreed.
Inhofe said he supports the administration's latest move. "While I have always stressed the need to have Senate-confirmed leadership in top Pentagon positions, I believe it is within the President's authority toappoint DoD officials when and as appropriate," he said in a statement on Monday afternoon. "These are clearly critical positions within the Department where a full bench is needed."
The post that Tata had been nominated for opened up when Trump dismissed John Rood in February after he opposed the Trump administration withholding aid money to Ukraine, an issue that was at the center of Trump's impeachment by the House. Rood was the top Pentagon official who certified that Ukraine had sufficiently met its anti-corruption targets in order to receive military aid as required by U.S. law. In an email to Esper a few hours after Trump's July 25, 2019, call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Rood wrote that "placing a hold on security assistance at this time would jeopardize this unique window of opportunity and undermine our defense priorities with a key partner in the strategic competition with Russia." The money was held anyway.
Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project at the liberal-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, said keeping someone like Tata in place when members of the president's own party are opposed to him is scandalous. "To me, avoiding the Senate's explicit advice and consent provision to install cronies for whom he has received little if any senatorial advice, and absolutely no consent, is an impeachable offense," Hauser said. "At the very least, appointees like Tata reflect Trump's antipathy toward good governance and provide context for America's worst-in-the-developed world response to covid-19."
CoronavirusA coronavirus vaccine won’t change the world right away.
"Public health experts are discussing among themselves a new worry: that hopes for a vaccine may be soaring too high. The confident depiction by politicians and companies that a vaccine is imminent and inevitable may give people unrealistic beliefs about how soon the world can return to normal — and even spark resistance to simple strategies that can tamp down transmission and save lives in the short term," Carolyn Johnson reports. "Two coronavirus vaccines entered the final stages of human testing last week, a scientific speed record that prompted top government health officials to utter words such as 'historic' and 'astounding.' Pharmaceutical executives predicted to Congress in July that vaccines might be available as soon as October, or before the end of the year. …But best-case scenarios have failed to materialize throughout the pandemic, and experts — who believe wholeheartedly in the power of vaccines — foresee a long path ahead. ' It seems, to me, unlikely that a vaccine is an off-switch or a reset button where we will go back to pre-pandemic times,' said Yonatan Grad, an assistant professor of infectious diseases and immunology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Or, as Columbia University virologist Angela Rasmussen puts it, 'It's not like we're going to land in Oz.' …
"Deploying the vaccine to people in the United States and around the world will test and strain distribution networks, the supply chain, public trust and global cooperation. It will take months or, more likely, years to reach enough people to make the world safe. …For those who do get a vaccine as soon as shots become available, protection won't be immediate — it takes weeks for the immune system to call up full platoons of disease-fighting antibodies. And many vaccine technologies will require a second shot weeks after the first to raise immune defenses.Immunity could be short-lived or partial, requiring repeated boosters that strain the vaccine supply or require people to keep social distancing and wearing masks even after they've received their shots. And if a vaccine works less well for some groups of people, if swaths of the population are reluctant to get a vaccine or if there isn't enough to go around, some people will still get sick even after scientists declare victory on a vaccine — which could help foster a false impression it doesn't work."
Scientists are worried about political influence over Operation Warp Speed.
"Under constant pressure from a White House anxious for good news and a public desperate for a silver bullet to end the crisis, the government's researchers are fearful of political intervention in the coming months and are struggling to ensure that the government maintains the right balance between speed and rigorous regulation, according to interviews with administration officials, federal scientists and outside experts," the Times reports."The desire to find a way to return to normal life is powerful and transcends partisan politics and borders. On Sunday, Russia announced that it planned to start a nationwide inoculation campaign in October with a vaccine that had yet to complete clinical trials, the latest evidence of the global potential for cutting corners. Despite concerted efforts by the Trump administration and a bevy of pharmaceutical companies it is working with, the original October target has slipped, with the administration now pushing to have hundreds of millions of doses available by the end of the year or early 2021.
"But experts inside and outside the government still say they fear the White House will push the Food and Drug Administration to overlook insufficient data and give at least limited emergency approval to a vaccine, perhaps for use by specific groups like front-line health care workers, before the vote on Nov. 3. 'There are a lot of people on the inside of this process who are very nervous about whether the administration is going to reach their hand into the Warp Speed bucket, pull out one or two or three vaccines, and say, "We've tested it on a few thousand people, it looks safe, and now we are going to roll it out," ' said Dr. Paul A. Offit of the University of Pennsylvania, who is a member of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccine advisory committee. ' They are really worried about that. And they should be.'"
Testing czar Brett Giroir said it's "time to move on" from hydroxychloroquine."Most physicians and prescribers are evidence-based, and they're not influenced by whatever is on Twitter or anything else. And the evidence just does not show hydroxychloroquine is effective right now," the assistant health secretary said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "We need to move on from that and talk about what is effective."
Debbie Birx said the pandemic has entered a "new phase." "What we are seeing today is different from March and April. It is extraordinarily widespread,"the White House coronavirus task force coordinator told CNN , noting that it's as rampant in rural areas as urban ones. A new ensemble forecast, published by the CDC, projects more than 173,000 American deaths by August 22.
Nancy Pelosi said she doesn't have confidence in Birx."I think the president has been spreading disinformation about the virus, and she is his appointee. So I don't have confidence there, no," the Democratic House speaker said on ABC's "This Week." Birx, on CNN, attributed Pelosi's criticism to a Times article that described Birx as having embraced overly optimistic assessments on the virus. ( Reuters )
Alaska, Hawaii, Missouri, Montana and Oklahoma are among the states experiencing the largest surges in new cases. At least 4,641,000 coronavirus cases and 151,000 fatalities have been confirmed in the United States. About 50,000 new cases and 478 deaths were reported on Sunday, a day of the week when numbers are often artificially low because some jurisdictions do not report data. (Antonia Farzan, Rick Noack and Lateshia Beachum )
Negotiators said they're still far apart on a coronavirus relief bill.
Pelosi, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows appeared on the Sunday shows a day after a rare weekend meeting at the Capitol yielded some signs of progress. "We still have a long ways to go," Meadows said on CBS's "Face the Nation." "I'm not optimistic that there will be a solution in the very near term." The three are scheduled to meet again today. "Mnuchin defended the administration's response to the pandemic, while pointing to Democrats' demands for $1 trillion in new state and local aid as a non-starter ," Erica Werner and Eli Rosenberg report. " Democrats continue to resist a short-term approach, and rejected an administration proposal to extend the $600 benefit for an additional week to give more time to negotiate. … Republicans have proposed reducing the $600 weekly payment to $200, or adopting a formula that would amount to replacing about two-thirds of a worker's wages before they were unemployed. … Pelosi suggested Democrats could be open to an approach that reduced the $600 over time as the unemployment rate declines, an idea that has been embraced by a number of congressional Democrats. …
"For many low-wage workers, the benefits have amounted to a bump in pay from what they were making at previous jobs. Studies have estimated between 40 and 68 percent of people on unemployment insurance are making more with the extra $600 than they were previously at work. But some preliminary studies on the issue have not found the temporary bump is a disincentive for a noticeable number of workers. A recent study by three Yale economists found workers receiving the extra benefits returned to work at roughly the same rate as others, finding 'no evidence that more generous benefits disincentivized work.'"
Trump is considering possible options for unilateral action if his negotiators cannot reach a deal with Congress. It's not clear what steps the administration could take without Congress on issues such as unemployment benefits, Erica Werner and Jeff Stein report .
A Federal Reserve Bank president is calling for the U.S. economy to be fully shut down for between four to six weeks. " The economy, which in the second quarter suffered its biggest blow since the Great Depression, would be able to mount a robust recovery, but only if the virus were brought under control, Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, told CBS," Reuters reports . "'If we don't do that and we just have this raging virus spreading throughout the country with flare-ups and local lockdowns for the next year or two, which is entirely possible, we're going to see many, many more business bankruptcies,' Kashkari said.' That's going to be a much slower recovery for all of us.'He said Congress is positioned to spend big on coronavirus relief efforts because the nation's budget gap can be financed without relying on foreign borrowing, given how much Americans are saving [by not going out]. 'That actually means that we have a lot more resources as a country to support those who have been laid off,' he said."
Millions of dollars from the Paycheck Protection Program went to China-backed businesses."Because the economic relief legislation allowed American subsidiaries of foreign firms to receive the loans, a substantial chunk of the money went to America's biggest economic rival," the Times reports ."According to a review of publicly available loan data by the strategy consulting firm Horizon Advisory, $192 million to $419 million has gone to more than 125 companies that Chinese entities own or invest in. Many of the loans were quite sizable; at least 32 Chinese companies received loans worth more than $1 million, with those totaling as much as $180 million."

San Francisco flattened the coronavirus curve early, but now cases are surging.
"More than four months after the region put some of the nation's first shelter-in-place orders in effect, the Bay Area is experiencing a surge in cases and counties are rolling back reopening plans," Heather Kelly and Rachel Lerman report . "The Bay Area, which consists of nine counties and nearly 8 million people, is a cautionary tale for government and health officials. Even though leaders here tried to do everything cautiously and by the book, cases still eventually spiked over a month and a half, to an average of 877 cases a day at the end of July from 217 a day in mid-June.Medical experts say a slow but steady rise in complacency is worsening the case count. Contact tracers have told public health researchers that people are getting sick after indoor gatherings. And the numbers show that Latino residents and essential workers are being hit the hardest."

The electionsJoe Biden’s delay in choosing a running mate is intensifying the jockeying between his potential picks.
"Biden has extended his vice-presidential search by as much as two weeks, " Annie Linskey reports. "The increasing nastiness is fueled by a sense, even among Biden's closest advisers, that Biden is entering the final phase of the search without a clear favorite. Rather than a traditional 'shortlist' of three candidates, people close to the process expect him to interview five or six finalists for the position. … In recent days a Politico report surfaced that former senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut, who is on Biden's vice-presidential vetting panel, told donors that Sen. Kamala D. Harris 'had no remorse' for her attacks on Biden while on a debate stage. One donor implied to CNBC that Harris has too much 'ambition.' And former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell, a longtime Biden friend, told CNN that Harris can 'rub people the wrong way.'
"Some of the comments are being made by high-ranking Democrats pushing alternative candidates such as Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) and more recently Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), making some worry that women of color are being forced to kneecap one another. 'It bugs me that people want to pit these two Black women against the other,' said Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), a key Biden confidant, referring to the burgeoning Bass vs. Harris narrative. …
"In recent days the negative attention has focused on Bass … The Daily Caller published a piece about a 2010 speech Bass gave at the ribbon cutting for a new Scientology facility that opened in Los Angeles, in which she seemed to praise the organization. The Atlantic published a lengthy article examining her past visits to Cuba and warm words for former leader Fidel Castro …
"Harris allies have been lobbying the Biden team in public and in private. Top racial justice lawyer Ben Crump, who represents the family of George Floyd, penned an op-ed for CNN supporting her candidacy. Behind the scenes, powerful allies like Glenda Baskin Glover, the head of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority and president of Tennessee State University, wrote to Biden's vetting team urging them to select Harris … And Harris attempted to use the attacks on her 'ambition' as a weapon. 'There will be a resistance to your ambition,' she said Friday during Black Girls Lead 2020, a virtual conference for young Black women. … 'But don't you let that burden you.' She also received an assist from Biden campaign manager Jennifer O'Malley Dillon that came soon after Dodd's comment. 'Ambitious women make history, change the world, and win,' O'Malley Dillon said in a social media post."
Trump keeps promising a health-care overhaul that never arrives.
"'We're signing a health-care plan within two weeks, a full and complete health-care plan,' Trump pledged in a July 19 interview with 'Fox News Sunday' anchor Chris Wallace.Now, with the two weeks expiring Sunday, there is no evidence that the administration has designed a replacement for the 2010 health-care law. Instead, there is a sense of familiarity," Anne Gearan, Amy Goldstein and Seung Min Kim report . On Friday, Trump told reporters in Florida that he'll be signing a new health-care plan "very soon." When a reporter noted that he told Wallace that he would sign it by Sunday, he added "Might be Sunday. But it's going to be very soon." (Nothing happened on Sunday).
"Trump's decision to revive a health-care promise that he has failed to deliver on — this time with less than 100 days before Election Day — carries political risks. …Nonetheless, some of Trump's allies said floating health-care ideas is a smart move by the president.Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who regularly meets and golfs with the president, said the health-care plan that Trump has referred to would come in the form of an executive order that Graham called 'fairly comprehensive.' However broad, an executive order would fall short of a full legislative overhaul."
Microsoft said it’s in talks to buy TikTok after speaking to Trump, who earlier said he would ban the Chinese-owned app.
"Microsoft said in a blog post that chief executive Satya Nadella and Trump had spoken and that the company is committed to addressing Trump's concerns about the social media platform. Trump previously indicated he was not in favor of a deal and said that he planned to ban TikTok in the United States," Rachel Lerman reports. "If it goes through, the acquisition could dramatically shift the Big Tech landscape, adding a legacy giant into the scramble for social media users' attention."
DeutscheBank opened a review into the longtime personal banker of Trump and Jared Kushner.
" In June 2013, the banker, RosemaryVrablic, and two of her DeutscheBank colleagues purchased a Park Avenue apartment for about $1.5 million from a company calledBergel715 Associates, " the Times reports. " Mr. Kushner, a senior adviser to the president, disclosed in an annual personal financial report late Friday that he and his wife, Ivanka Trump, had received $1 million to $5 million last year fromBergel715. A person familiar with Mr. Kushner's finances ... said he held an ownership stake in the entity at the time of the transaction with Ms.Vrablic.
"When Ms.Vrablicand her colleagues bought the apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side, Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner were her clients atDeutscheBank. They had received roughly $190 million in loans from the bank and would seek hundreds of millions of dollars more.Typicallybanks restrict employees from doing personal business with clients because of the potential for conflicts between the employees' interests and those of the bank.DeutscheBank said it had not been aware that Ms.Vrablicand her colleagues had done business with a company part-owned by Kushner until being contacted by the Times."
John Podesta played Biden in an election “war game” with a scenario similar to 2016 – and refused to concede.
The scenario featured "a big popular win for Mr. Biden, and a narrow electoral defeat, presumably reached after weeks of counting the votes in Pennsylvania. For their war game, they cast John Podesta, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, in the role of Mr. Biden. They expected him, when the votes came in, to concede, just as Mrs. Clinton had," the Times reports . "But Mr. Podesta, playing Mr. Biden, shocked the organizers by saying he felt his party wouldn't let him concede. Alleging voter suppression, he persuaded the governors of Wisconsin and Michigan to send pro-Biden electors to the Electoral College.In that scenario, California, Oregon, and Washington then threatened to secede from the United States if Mr. Trump took office as planned. The House named Mr. Biden president; the Senate and White House stuck with Mr. Trump. At that point in the scenario, the nation stopped looking to the media for cues, and waited to see what the military would do."
The White House chief of staff backed away from Trump's suggestion about delaying the election and said the president does not plan to pursue the matter with Congress. "There was a question mark," Meadows said of the tweet that set off a firestorm. ( Joseph Marks )
The Republican National Committee disputed a claim that Trump's nomination for a second term will be closed to media."Two RNC officials insisted Sunday that they are still working through the logistics and press coverage options, a break with a statement reportedly made by a GOP convention spokesperson the previous day," Felicia Sonmez reports .
Primaries in Kansas and Tennessee are triggering GOP family feuds over who can deliver more for Trump.
In Kansas, Kris Kobach, former secretary of state and one of his party's most divisive figures, is facing off against two-term Republican Rep. Roger Marshall for their party's nomination to a Senate seat. National Republicans are trying to stop Kobach, often using attacks that originated with liberal magazines or think tanks, David Weigel and Paul Kane report . "Kansas is one of two states with GOP Senate primaries this week that have a back-to-the-future outlook, with Tennessee voters similarly choosing between an establishment-backed candidate and an insurgent conservative trying to lay claim to the true ideological mantle.There, Bill Hagerty, most recently ambassador to Japan, has the full backing of Trump and appeared to be cruising to a victory in the primary, which would make him the prohibitive favorite to win the general election given Tennessee's conservative lean. …But Manny Sethi, a trauma surgeon who runs a health-care nonprofit, has caught a late burst of momentum in the race that drew the attention of Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), both of whom endorsed Sethi. …Their moves also give a hint of how, if Trump loses in November, this constellation of conservatives hope to recreate the same sort of ideological challenges to Republicans that dominated primaries in 2010, 2012 and 2014."
A new super PAC for Rep. Joe Kennedy III in his primary challenge against Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) has reserved $1.6 million worth ofairtime. The effort is organized by Mindy Myers, the former executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and members of the Kennedy family are among those making calls to raise money for the effort, including Kennedy's twin brother, Matthew Kennedy, according to the Boston Globe .
Divided AmericaPortland protests this weekend were calmer after federal agents backed down.
" The protests that have stretched on for 66 straight nights in downtown Portland may be reaching a turning point: The weekend brought none of the large-scale tear gas and firework-fueled clashes that marked the previous two months of unrest," Adam Taylor and Eli Rosenberg report. "But it's not clear what direction the protests in the city, which show no sign of stopping, will take next. ... The protest's epicenter downtown near a federal courthouse was quiet Saturday for the third night in a row as state police opted for a hands-off approach ... Yet another flash point emerged in southeast Portland, as city police rushed protesters with riot shields and pepper spray before arresting two. ... Many protesters say it was an overreaction from a police force … 'Some protesters make the argument that if we were all just peaceful, the police would stop messing with us,' Kevin, a 22-year-old carpenter who had arrived at the downtown protest at 9 p.m. Friday and stayed until the early hours of Sunday. 'But some nights we are peaceful, and they still mess with us!'"
In Georgia, a long-serving sheriff is seeking reelection against an African American opponent who is wondering if his neighbors will vote for a Black candidate. The race between Sheriff Harry Young and Duke Donaldson in Grady County – aRepublican stronghold – has become a referendumnot only on Young but on all he has come to represent in acounty where the face of law enforcement has always been White and male.

The Navy is investigating a demonstration of military working dogs attacking a handler in a Colin Kaepernick jersey.
" Video of the event last year surfaced on social media over the weekend, with one version receiving 2.6 million views. The event was held by the National Navy SEAL Museum, a nonprofit organization that is not overseen by the Navy," Alex Horton reports . " The incident is under investigation, but the Navy thinks the dog handlers seen in the video were museum employees and contractors, not active-duty sailors ...Kaepernick, 32, who was a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, has been criticized by Trump and other conservatives for kneeling during the national anthem before NFL games to protest police brutality. The Navy described the handler attacked by the dogs as a 'target' for a demonstration on the use of military working dogs to surprise and subdue enemy troops on the battlefield."
Foreign journalists working for the federal Voice of America fear that they’ll be kicked out of the country.
" For decades, VOA's foreign staff have routinely had their visas renewed by VOA's parent organization, enabling them to fill jobs for which they have special experience and expertise," Paul Farhi reports."But the new chief executive of VOA's parent agency, a Trump appointee named Michael Pack, has stopped renewing visas, leaving 76 VOA employees like [reporter Bricio] Segovia facing imminent removal — and undermining the agency's ability to deliver news to non-English-speaking audiences around the world, staffers argue. Pack hasn't said why. 'We are here because we worked for it, by the merits, legally,' says Segovia, an experienced journalist who speaks seven languages … [VOA reporters] include people from countries headed by authoritarian regimes who fear persecution once they are repatriated, among them journalists from Venezuela, China, Russia, Iran and other nations in which VOA's broadcasts serve as one of the few sources of independent news and information."

Full text: Stocks slipped, paring gains from earlier in the week, after data showed another wave of Americans applied for unemployment benefits because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Markets initially wobbled between small gains and losses, then dropped solidly into negative territory as the afternoon progressed.
Thursday's drawback came after Labor Department data showed about 2.4 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the week ending May 16, extending a swift and severe deterioration in the labor market.
More than 38 million Americans have filed applications since mid-March, when the pandemic brought business and travel to a standstill.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 101.78 points, or 0.4%, to 24474.12 Thursday. The S&P 500 lost 23.1 points, or 0.8%, to 2948.51 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 90.90 points, or 1%, to 9284.88.
Despite Thursday's decline, stocks are still on pace for big weekly gains, with investors attributing the market's broader ascent to optimism that coronavirus vaccines might be available later this year. The Food and Drug Administration has fast-tracked the process for experimental vaccines, and drugmaker Moderna this week reported positive results from the first human study of its experimental coronavirus vaccine.
Still, a viable product is at least months away. Some analysts caution that a sustained market rebound may be premature. "Even if this is the vaccine everyone is hoping for, it's still 12 months before it comes to the market," said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. "What we're seeing today is more of a reality check. You've got undue optimism with the equity market."
Among individual stocks, Best Buy fell $3.56, or 4.4%, to $77.98 after the electronics retailer reported lower first-quarter sales and earnings.
TJX, parent of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, rose $3.45, or 6.8%, to $54.30 after the company said it has reopened more than 1,600 stores world-wide and that its stores could be largely reopened by the end of next month.
In a sign of rising tensions between Washington and Beijing, President Trump tweeted Wednesday that China's "disinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe is a disgrace." That comes on top of the Senate on Wednesday approving legislation that could force Chinese companies to give up their listings on American stock exchanges.
"What the trade rhetoric does is it does create uncertainty in a market where there is lots and lots of uncertainty," said Justin Onuekwusi, head of retail multiasset funds at Legal & General Investment Management.
In Europe, stocks were broadly lower, with the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 dropping 0.7%.
China early Friday broke with more than a quarter-century of tradition by not setting an economic growth target for 2020, an acknowledgment of the challenges facing the world's second-largest economy as it grapples with uncertainties around the coronavirus pandemic.
Stocks moved lower in Asia amid the grim news. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 3.5%, the Shanghai Composite and South Korea's Kospi were down 1% and Japan's Nikkei was down 0.4%. U.S. stock futures were down 0.4%.

Full text: THE TICKER
Stocks tanked yesterday on deepening coronavirus fears, prompting President Trump and his team to cheerlead the market carnage as a buying opportunity.
The public display of optimism from the administration came after a grisly day on Wall Street. The new disease clusters in Italy, Iran and South Korea over the weekend stoked a sense among investors that the virus has escaped early attempts at containment and could pose a more serious and sustained threat to global growth.
The Dow Jones industrial average sank 3.6 percent and the S&P 500 was off 3.4 percent, with both erasing their gains for the year . The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which had been surging, fared even worse, shedding 3.7 percent.
Trump sought to reassure investors following the market close, stressing U.S. public health officials are on top of the threat and suggesting stocks have bottomed out and investors should buy back in:
Larry Kudlow, Trump's top economic adviser, echoed the sentiment in an interview with my colleague Bob Costa:
It's precarious ground to stake out. Attempting to call a market bottom is a dicey enough task for investment professionals. It's more difficult amid an unpredictable global health crisis. And there's arguably little to justify the risk for a president who will be called on to manage the response if the coronavirus defies his reassurances and arrives in the United States as a major problem.
That's especially true considering the stock market is not the economy. As Deutsche Bank Securities chief economist Torsten Slok recently noted, the share of the population that has benefited from the S&P 500's rise has shrunk since the financial crisis more than a decade ago:
But the president has already firmly established that voters should look to the performance of the stock market as a proxy for his own economic stewardship. Just this month, he boasted about market highs twice on Twitter:
Trump's kids have gotten in on the act, too:
The president's preoccupation with the stock market has shaped his response to the coronavirus menace. "On Jan. 31, the same day several airlines suspended flights and the United States announced its escalated response, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 600 points, or 2 percent. Trump grew concerned that any stronger action by his administration would hurt the economy, and he has told advisers that he does not want the administration to do or say anything that would further spook the markets ," my colleagues Yasmeen Abutaleb and Josh Dawsey reported last week. "He remains worried that any large-scale outbreak could hurt his reelection bid."
Trump has sought to project calm since then, telling Fox News's Sean Hannity earlier this month, "We pretty much shut it down coming in from China." But "behind the scenes, the Trump administration rushed to expand its response to the coronavirus and rebound from missteps that had drawn the president's ire and raised questions about the government's readiness to address the outbreak," my colleagues Toluse Olorunnipa and Bob Costa report.
Trump's team remains riven internally about the best path forward, as it eyes the political cost of a longer-term market downturn , per Toluse and Bob. "If he gets a real correction, a 10 to 15 percent down draft in the market, it'd take one of the legs off of a very big part of his reelection campaign," financier and former Trump hand Anthony Scaramucci tells them.
What course the disease follows, and the fallout for growth abroad and at home, remains anybody's guess. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin acknowledged as much in a CNBC interview, saying officials need "another three or four weeks to see how the virus reacts until we really have good statistical data."
But the market action on Monday bore all the hallmarks of a freakout over the virus's toll. Travel companies took some of the toughest pummeling, with American Airlines shares dropping 8.5 percent and Delta Air Lines dropping 6.3 percent. Bleach maker Clorox was a rare bright spot, climbing 1.55 percent, and while Kleenex maker Kimberly Clark, Campbells Soup Co., and Hormel Foods all dipped, they outperformed the broader market.
Investors fled to safe havens, "sending the price of gold soaring as government bond yields, which move opposite prices, plumbed new depths. Oil also fell into bear market territory amid expectations of prolonged global weakness," The Post's David Lynch, Rachel Siegel and Thomas Heath write. And traders now see a greater than 80 percent chance the Federal Reserve cuts its benchmark interest rate at least once by the end of July, though it is hardly clear monetary policymakers have the tools necessary to mitigate the sort of supply-chain shock a worst-case scenario could bring.
"If all of a sudden cases appear in Silicon Valley, or Manhattan — closer to home and in areas that have greater implications for the market or earnings — we could see continued declines," Wedbush Securities Managing Director Steve Massocca tells me. "But it's too early to tell."
Scot Lance, managing director at San Mateo, Calif.-based Titus Wealth Management, takes a sunnier view. "I think this is likely presenting itself as a fairly good buying opportunity," he tells me. "Our clients base I would say overall has been very slightly underinvested and has been looking for some type of pullback in order to get back into the market… I don't think necessarily that this will cause a 20 percent pullback. I believe it will be relatively modest." 
You are reading The Finance 202 , our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.
— Markets stabilize somewhat. The Post's Adam Taylor: "Global markets mostly stabilized after Monday's heavy losses, although fears over the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic continued to haunt investors. Major European indexes were down about 0.8 percent, and oil futures were also lower. Asian stocks were a little lower overall, although the Nikkei, which was closed on Monday, fell more than 3 percent as it caught up with losses elsewhere."
Fed remains in wait-and-see mode. WSJ's Nick Timiraos: "Federal Reserve officials said it was too soon to know how the fallout from the coronavirus, which weighed heavily on global markets Monday, would ripple through the U.S. economy and whether it would force a return to interest-rate cuts later this year… In a speech Monday, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said she was comfortable with the central bank's current interest-rate posture and was closely watching the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on global growth."
U.S. companies are surviving China's slowdown, for now. The Post's Jeanne Whalen and Abha Bhattarai: "The next few weeks will be crunchtime for U.S. companies awaiting products from stalled Chinese factories. If their suppliers spring back to life soon, many companies say they should be able to manage without disastrous disruption. But the uncertainty is keeping managers up at night.
"The variables go beyond the number of employees allowed to return to work after weeks of quarantine. Factories will need enough raw materials to restore production, and enough protective masks to keep workers safely in place for the foreseeable future. They'll also need Chinese truckers and functioning ports to ensure that goods can make it to market."
More companies are issuing warnings. Bloomberg News's Angus Whitley: "Mastercard Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. emerged as the latest companies to warn that sales and profit are getting hurt as the epidemic spreads meaningfully beyond its center in China's Hubei province… The U.S. credit-card network cut its revenue-growth forecast as the spread of infections puts off travelers. Chicago-based United scrapped its 2020 profit forecast altogether, underscoring the unpredictable nature of the two-month-old health emergency."
Putting Monday's market carnage in perspective . As usual, the number to stress is the percentage decline, not the point drop. Per LPL Financial's Ryan Detrick: 
More from Detrick:
— Sanders unveils massive child-care plan: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) "proposed spending $1.5 trillion over 10 years to create a universal child care and early education system, to be funded by taxing the wealthiest Americans," Reuters's Jason Lange reports.
"At least 10 hours of childcare a day would be available from infancy through age three, the age at which early-education programs would kick in, according to Sanders' proposal. Sanders said the program would be paid for by taxing the wealth of the richest 0.1 percent of Americans." 
— Bloomberg once called Warren 'scary': "Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg said at a private event in 2016 that his presidential campaign platform would have been to 'defend the banks' and also labeled the progressive movement and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, now a rival for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, as 'scary,' " CNN's Andrew Kaczynski and Em Steck report. 
"When asked his views on the rise of the far right in Europe, Bloomberg warned about the rise of progressive politicians in the U.S., citing Warren. 'The left is arising. The progressive movement is just as scary,' he says. 'Elizabeth Warren on one side. And whoever you want to pick on the Republicans on the right side?' " CNN confirmed that Bloomberg made the comments during a private event hosted by Goldman Sachs at Yankee Stadium in the summer of 2016.
He also slammed Obama: "Bloomberg, who was elected mayor as a Republican and as an independent, also criticized President Barack Obama, saying that his 2012 endorsement of Obama was 'backhanded' and that he thought Republican Mitt Romney could have done a better job if he'd been elected."
Bloomberg's campaign said the bank comments were a joke: "The opening line was a joke," Bloomberg campaign spokesman Stu Loeser told CNN He added: "In the more serious parts of the speech, Mike tells very wealthy Americans that they need to break their addiction to cheap money that's exacerbating income inequality in America."
Warren's campaign leapt on the report, snapping up "ScareMikeBloomberg.com" — a URL that redirects to a fundraising page for her:
— Facebook investigated suspicious pro-Sanders posts: "Facebook Inc. in recent weeks investigated suspicious content supporting [Sanders's] presidential campaign, said people familiar with the matter. But the company was unable to substantiate claims that Trump supporters or Russian actors were involved in any inauthentic activity," the WSJ's Emily Glazer and Dustin Volz report.
"Some in Facebook's leadership were briefed recently on the investigation, some of the people said. It couldn't be learned whether the probe is continuing. Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said the company investigated a claim by an outside researcher over suspicious pro-Sanders content, among regular reports it generally receives from the research community. While Facebook actively monitors its platform for political disinformation, not all internal inquiries are escalated to senior officials, as this one was, people familiar with the matter said." 
TRADE FLY-AROUND:
— U.S. considers expelling Chinese journalists: "The U.S. is weighing whether to expel Chinese journalists after China kicked out three Wall Street Journal reporters, part of a push by the Trump administration to show leaders in Beijing that it will resist restrictions on Americans working in China," Bloomberg News's Nick Wadhams, Jennifer Jacobs and Saleha Mohsin report.
"The administration's options were to be discussed in a meeting of senior administration leaders at the White House … led by Matt Pottinger, the deputy national security adviser who was once a Wall Street Journal reporter in Beijing, according to U.S. officials familiar with the deliberations. There's an intense debate over how severely to respond to the expulsions last week. Some advocate ordering dozens — and perhaps hundreds — of Chinese reporters to leave, while others say that's not legally possible or in keeping with American values on freedom of the press, according to several of the officials."
Top Cabinet officials urge restraint: "Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are among those arguing for a more moderate approach, especially as the U.S. needs to work with China in stemming the coronavirus outbreak, one person familiar with the discussions said." 
— Xi's coronavirus response foreshadows tighter grip: "For all the lessons for President Xi Jinping to take away from China's worst virus outbreak in modern history, he seems to have settled on one above all others: Centralized control works and more is needed," Bloomberg News reports.
"Xi shared the conclusion in an unprecedented conference call with 170,000 officials Sunday — the closest the leader of the world's longest-lasting communist regime has come to a fireside chat. In it, according to excerpts released by state-run media, he defended the ruling party's judgment as 'accurate' and argued that the outbreak 'demonstrates the remarkable advantages of the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system with Chinese characteristics.' While the statement echoes countless others by Xi since he came to power more than seven years ago, China's response to the coronavirus outbreak has given the world a new understanding of what he means." 
— Moderna makes big move in coronavirus fight: "Drugmaker Moderna Inc. has shipped the first batch of its rapidly developed coronavirus vaccine to U.S. government researchers, who will launch the first human tests of whether the experimental shot could help suppress the epidemic originating in China," the WSJ's Peter Loftus reports.
"[The company] sent vaccine vials from its Norwood, Mass., manufacturing plant to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., the company said. The institute expects by the end of April to start a clinical trial of about 20 to 25 healthy volunteers, testing whether two doses of the shot are safe and induce an immune response likely to protect against infection, NIAID Director Anthony Fauci said in an interview. Initial results could become available in July or August."
Gilead drug also shows promise . Bloomberg News: "China will release results at the end of April from clinical trials of a Gilead Sciences Inc. drug that is emerging as a frontrunner in the race to find an effective treatment for the novel coronavirus. The outcome of trials of the experimental medication remdesivir on 761 patients in Wuhan, the city where the virus originated, will be made public on April 27, China's National Intellectual Property Administration said Tuesday…
"Foster City, California-based Gilead, whose remdesivir is not licensed or approved for use anywhere in the world, seems poised to benefit as confidence grows in its drug's efficacy in treating the coronavirus. If the trials prove remdesivir works, China could roll out the treatment more quickly than the usual deployment of new drugs due to the critical need among patients."
Other drugmakers are trying: "Drugmakers Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi SA and Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. have started to develop coronavirus vaccines, and human studies of them could start in anywhere from a few months to about a year from now," Loftus also reports.
— JPMorgan unveiling climate plans: "JPMorgan Chase & Co executives plan to announce new climate-change initiatives [today], including restrictions on financing coal mining and Arctic drilling, as well as a $200 billion target to provide financing for sustainable projects," Reuters's Elizabeth Dilts Marshall reports.
"The bank's changing approach at its 13th annual investor day, which is invitation-only, comes as other big U.S. banks have announced similar initiatives." 
— Saudis look to challenge U.S. on natural gas: "Saudi Aramco is launching the biggest shale gas development outside of the United States to boost domestic gas supply and end the burning of oil at its power generation plants, Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser told Reuters," Rania El Gamal and Simon Webb report.
"The world's top crude oil exporter has for years battled for market share with rapidly expanding shale oil producers in the United States, which in just a decade have developed capacity to pump millions of barrels per day of oil from rock formations that were previously too costly to tap … If Aramco hits its targets for development of the field, Saudi Arabia would become the world's third largest gas producer by 2030. The world's top two gas producers are the United States and Russia." 
— Boeing adds to board: Boeing "nominated Steve Mollenkopf and Akhil Johri to its board and said two of its directors will retire," Reuters's Sanjana Shivdas reports.
"Edward Liddy and Mike Zafirovski will retire at the U.S. planemaker's annual shareholder meeting and not stand for re-election, the company said. Mollenkopf is the chief executive officer of Qualcomm Inc and Johri was the chief financial officer of United Technologies Corp."
