Full text: Three of the four candidates for Cook County Board president spoke to the LGBTQ community Nov. 29 at a forum hosted by the Social Justice Alliance of Affinity Community Services, which includes Affinity, Coalition for Justice and Respect, Windy City Black LGBT Pride and Youth Pride Services.
Cook County Circuit Court Clerk Dorothy Brown, Chicago Alderman Toni PreckwinkLe and Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago President Terranee O'Brien attended. Current Cook County President Todd Stroger was absent, although forum organizers said he was expected to be there. Affinity Executive Director Kirn Hunt said she had not received any word from Stroge^s office about why he failed to show up as planned.
U.S. Rep. Danny Davis, D-7th, who recently dropped out of the race for county board president, moderated the discussion.
Brown, PreckwinkLe and O'Brien answered questions about their views on the controversial Cook County sa Les tax; funding to treat and prevent sexuaLLy transmitted infections (STIs); violence against LGBTQ people; and their goals for their first 90 days in office.
Brown said she would work to "strategica LLy Lower the county's sales tax, while replacing it with new revenue and Lower expenses." She said hiring collection agencies and entering into advertising contracts might be solutions to generate new revenue.
"We will work on finding revenue without raising taxes," Brown said.
PreckwinkLe said she also supports an elimination "over time" of Stroge^s penny-on-thedoLlar sa Les tax increase. She spoke out strong Ly in favor of making permanent the independent board that was created Last year to oversee the Cook County HeaLth & Hospitals System.
"The independent governance board of the heaLthcare system has aLready proven itseLf," PreckwinkLe said, pointing to cost savings since the board was created.
O'Brien took a more aggressive stance on the saLes tax than his opponents. "The first thing I would do is repeaL the 1 percent saLes tax increase," he said.
O'Brien said the higher saLes tax has driven businesses out of the county and taken jobs away from residents. He also said he wo u Ld consider aLternative sentencing for non-vioLent offenders Like home confinement and eLectronic monitoring to cut costs and reduce the population at Cook County Jail.
When asked how he'd ensure equitable distribution of funding among Cook County communities to treat and prevent STIs, O'Brien said he would Look to organizations Like Affinity and AIDS Foundation of Chicago for guidance. "What we need to do in county government is work with community groups," he said.
O'Brien also said he'd work to improve medicaL biLL coLLections and wo u Ld pursue state and federaL grants for heaLth care.
Brown said she would "want to make sure resources are properLy aLLocated to the communities that need them most." She said she issued her own executive order against discrimination at the cLerk's office and pointed out that she has received awards from African-American and LGBTQ community groups.
"I have a history of heLping in this area and I wiLL continue to do that," she said.
On the broader issue of county heaLth care. Brown said she would strive to work closeLy with the Department of PubLic HeaLth. She also said she would try to increase funding for medical testing, referrals and prevention.
Tm going to create a grants and research department to make sure we're going after every grant that is available," Brown said.
PreckwinkLe said she would emphasize prevention of STIs, particularly in the African-American community. "STIs aren't prevaLent in equaL proportion among the different ethnic groups in Chicago," she said.
She also applauded Cook County's Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center, and said she would try to ensure the center continues to receive adequate funding.
ALL three candidates said they would work to prevent violence against LGBTQ peopLe.
Brown said she would form an advisory committee of community groups to solicit advice on curtaiLing vioLence against LGBTQ peopLe. She said hate crimes based on sexuaL orientation, Like domestic vioLence, can be reduced with education and training for Law enforcement.
"We have to raise awareness, just Like with domestic vioLence - Law enforcement didn't take that seriously a few years ago," Brown said.
O'Brien said that first we have to encourage LGBTQ victims to report attacks. "Then we have to work with the State's Attorney to send the message that we wiLL not toLerate hate crimes," he said.
PreckwinkLe similarly emphasized the importance of "vigorous" prosecution of hate crimes. But, she added that she wo u Ld use her post as Cook County board president to raise awareness about violence and discrimination against LGBTQ peopLe.
"The president of the Cook County board should use the position as a puLpit to ... stand up for equaLity for aLL of our citizens," she said.
PreckwinkLe also said she is the only candidate for county board president who supports the Legalization of same-sex marriage. Brown and O'Brien both said they support civil unions.
