Full text: A former A Safe Place employee has filed a charge of discrimination against the company, aLleging the executive director sexually harassed and unfairly terminated her when the pair's romantic relationship went south.
In a statement filed with the ILlinois Department of Human Rights and the EquaL Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), Elizabeth Cartee - who worked for A Safe Place from February 2008 to December 2010- said she and Executive Director PhyLLis DeMott were invoLved in an intimate reLationship during Cartee's empLoyment.
Cartee alLeged that when she ended the reLationship, DeMott retaliated by changing Cartee's job duties, suspending and eventually firing her. Cartee claimed that DeMott conditioned Cartee's return to work on the submission of private medical records pertaining to her treatment for depression. Cartee said DeMott knew about the treatment because of their reLationship.
"Ms. Cartee was absoluteLy victimized by A Safe Place," Cartee's Lawyer, Betty Tsamis, said. "It's important for an organization and a company to understand that just because the two players are of the same sex that doesn't make it any Less iLLegaL or any Less offensive."
A Safe Place Lawyer Brian Schwartz said Cartee's claims have no merit.
"A Safe Place categoricaLly denies the daims of discrimination made by Ms. Cartee," he said. "In fact, A Safe PLace's deniaL is supported by the Aug. 8, 2011 EEOC dismissal of Ms. Cartee's aLlegations. Ms. Cartee is a disgruntLed former empLoyee who voluntarily abandoned her job without any conduct by A Safe Place that indicated she should do so."
The EEOC ruLed Aug. 8 that it wouLd not investigate Cartee's claim; the commission instead issued a right to sue. Tsamis said she plans to file a Lawsuit seeking damages for Lost income.
"I Lost my apartment," Cartee said. "She took everything from me. She reaLLy did. And whiLe I have to claim some responsibility for it going that way, ifs a classic case of sexual harassment. ... Same-sex harassment is just as bad, and it goes on. PeopLe Look the other way. They think it doesn't merit getting in trouble for, and it was certain Ly as bad as anything I've ever experienced."
A Safe Place provides safe housing and supportive counseLing options to survivors of domestic violence, for free.
