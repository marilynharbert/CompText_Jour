Full text: Â  The WNBA has suspended AIL-Stars and married couple Brittney Griner and Glory Johnson for seven games each after their domestic violence arrests in April.
The two were arrested on suspicion of assault after a fight in the home they recently bought. They were married recentLy in Phoenix.
WNBA President Laurel J. Richie said in a statement issued May 15, "The WNBA takes alL acts of violence extremeLy seriously. It is our strong belief that violence has absolutely no pLace in society, in sports or in this league.
"As president, it is my responsibility to protect the league and uphold its values. Our athLetes represent the WNBA, and they all must abide by the league's standards of conduct. In this case, Brittney and Glory faiLed to do so, and that is unacceptable."
Richie also said that Griner pled guilty April 28 in Goodyear City Court to misdemeanor disorderly conduct; Griner has to complete a 26-week course and, upon doing so, the disorder-conduct charge will be dismissed. Johnson's case (transferred to county court) is pending.
