Abstract: EH: I would and I have. [Andy Kirchoff] has to make me look like I'm not my own person. I did not get into office very easily and it wasn't through the help of [Madigan]. The first time I threw in my hat was in 2002 and there was no incumbent. I saw an opportunity for change, however I didn't win even on the second time because I was working against a very hard machine. I am not a Madigan follower.

Full text: Â  Elizabeth Hernandez has served as the Illinois House Representative for the people of the 24th District for well over a decade.
Currently vice-chair of Illinois Legislative Latino Caucus, during her tenure, Hernandez has been a staunch proponent of immigrant rights and has tackled and won on issues including domestic violence, low-income child care assistance and anti-crime programs.
However, both nationally and on a state level, incumbent challengers have asserted that 2016 needs to be a change year, particularly in Illinois where the continuing budget impasse in Springfield has angered and frustrated voters who are seeing vital social services impacted by what many believe is inaction on the part of legislators.
Hernandez now faces a serious threat to her seat in the form of Republican Andy Kirchoff, whose campaign is gathering both momentum and endorsements.
Hernandez spoke with Windy City Times and laid out her case for another term.
Windy City Times: Kirchoff said that he once called your office and got a threemonth old voicemail, that you are not there for your constituents and that, politically, you play it safe. How do you answer those accusations?
Elizabeth Hernandez: Three months? Come on. It's complete exaggeration and lies. It's just a way to discredit me in one way or another. My strongest area is my constituency, in terms of responding to and working with my constituents. Does the phone answer every time someone calls? No. I can't be sure that it's 100 percent. I have three full time staff [members] so it would be practically impossible unless they call when the office is closed. My [house] attendance record is that I've been there every single day. As a matter of fact, [Kirchoff] took some folks to Springfield and it was almost like he was poking around to see how I would react. I was responsive and addressed the folks who came in even though it had to do with an issue we are not on the same page about.
WCT: The budget crisis is on the mind of a lot of people and they are looking at legislators with the feeling that maybe some house cleaning is needed to get it sorted. As an incumbent, why is such change unnecessary and how will this impasse then be resolved?
EH: I'm in my fifth term and there is a reason people have put me there. There has to be some sense of trust or confidence in me to hoist their concerns in Springfield. Since the time that I have been in office, I've been very careful on what committees I selected because how I selected them was a reflection on my district. Two particular committees that I sit on that have to do with funding are Appropriations for Elementary and Secondary Education, and Appropriations for Human Services. That is what is extremely important: having a voice at the table to make a difference when you're in discussion. In terms of the budget, in order for us to have reached some agreement there had to be agenda items that the governor wanted. That agenda called for doing away with what sustains middle class and low income people. I was one of the ones who fought hard to ensure that, in the Stopgap budget, we put funding back into services that was taken away.
In the stopgap budget were able to, at least temporarily, meet the needs that the people in my district were depending on. I have a district that has two schools that are on the verge of closing. I can't go back, I will not go back to constituency empty-handed. Through some of the work, some of the negotiations, we were at least able to work out year-round school finding but, I'm going to be very honest with you, we are not out of the woods. Our community needs someone who is experienced and who has a real understanding of how we have to move ahead. I admire Andy for throwing in his hat, but he has a lot to learn. He's not there.
WCT: Would you be prepared to go against Speaker Madigan to fight for your district?
EH: I would and I have. Andy has to make me look like I'm not my own person. I did not get into office very easily and it wasn't through the help of Madigan. The first time I threw in my hat was in 2002 and there was no incumbent. I saw an opportunity for change, however I didn't win even on the second time because I was working against a very hard machine. I am not a Madigan follower. I'm in agreement with a lot that he has done because I think it's going to benefit my community. Am I always? No, I'm not. The speaker has heard the voice of my district and he respects that.
WCT: Something you've fought really hard for is immigration. Among Trump's many positions is the penalizing of safe cities and the introduction of a deportation squad. This is going to affect the people in your district should he prevail. How do you fight any anti-immigrant initiatives that may come out of a Trump presidency?
EH: What most people don't know is that there are different ways that immigration has presented itself. In Springfield, there's been a series of anti-immigrant bills that have been introduced but, though my efforts and others, we've been very fortunate to keep those from even moving. That is what is needed in Springfield: to be a watchdog so that we don't have any laws that would take us backward.
Locally, I have people who come into my office with issues of a family member facing deportation. Even in my own town of Cicero, there have been issues and I've had to confront the administration with what is happening. I was part of pushing Cicero to pass a resolution for them to be a sanctuary. If there is interruption to that, it absolutely has to be brought to their attention.
WCT: Since the Orlando massacre, a lot of people in the LGBTQ community want to see the NRA fought in order to get guns off the streets of Chicago. There's a sense that legislators run and hide from the NRA. How would you approach fighting such a wellorganized lobbying body?
EH: I think there needs to be more restrictions and safety. My husband is retired law enforcement so we have our differences but there are no guns in my house. I won that fight. I'm not a friend of the NRA and, believe me, they've reached out to me in many ways. I just never give in to it. I'm a strong supporter of ant-gun measures.
