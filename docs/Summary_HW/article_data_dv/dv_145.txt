Full text: Â  It's been a decade of extreme differences for Courtney Feuer, a teacher at Lane Tech High School on Chicago's North Side - on the personal front, that is.
During her first few years at Lane Tech, she hid her sexual orientation from almost everyone - students, administrators, parents and even fellow teachers.
"I was very careful about how much [information] I snared about myself," said Feuer, originally from Columbus, Ohio, and a Chicago resident since 1997. "I definitely did not tell students [about my sexual orientation], and was very careful about what I told colleagues."
And when she brought Kris Himebaugh, her wife, to events, they were friends, thafs it, nothing more. They didn't hold hands in public, and Feuer never introduced Himebaugh as her wife.
"I was careful about that for a while," said Feuer, 38, who came out as a sophomore at Miami (Ohio) University in 1994.
Feuer and Himebaugh, also a CPS teacher, have been together for nine years. They have twin children, two dogs and a cat, and live in the Edgewater neighborhood.
As Feuer built seniority at the school, she also started coming out more and more, perhaps to a student or a teacher here or there.
Then she became pregnant, and there was no hiding anymore, she said.
"I just thought, 'How can I bring children into the world and not be honest about my family?'" Feuer said.
Since coming out, the second time, "I have only had positive responses."
No negative responses from parents, students, faculty, or anyone.
"It's been surprisingly comfortable," she said.
In fact, a few years ago, a student came out to Feuer - and she had no idea or even a suspicion that he was gay. He told her, "Since you've been so out about your Life, I had the courage to come out to my mom."
Feuer added, "If thafs the only thing [positive] to happen because of being out, thafs fantastic."
Feuer participated in an It Gets Better video, produced by broadcast students. Himebaugh and their kids (Byron and Leona) also were in the video, filmed on campus and ultimately aired on the school news.
Feuer taught British Literature and women in Literature this year, her 10th at Lane Tech.
"The dialogue at schooL has gotten so much better," said Feuer, who has photos of Himebaugh and their kids on display in her classroom.
"I have never had an issue [being gay], which is so refreshing. It's also something that I never envisioned. When I first started here, I'LL admit, I was terrified about being discovered as gay."
The principaL at the schooL when she started was very religious, so Feuer said he felt forced to remain siLent about her orientation. The next principaL, "I think she knew [that I was gay], but don't know [for certain]," Feuer said.
When Feuer told schooL administrators that she was on going on maternity Leave, she met with the assistant principaL who was known for being very religious, very conservative. "When I Left her office that day, she said, 'Congratulations and pLease teLl your husband congratuLations, too,'" Feuer recalled.
For the first time with an administrator, Feuer then came out.
Feuer said, "ActuaLLy, if s my wife."
The administrator was very apologetic, Feuer said. In fact, the administrator went out of her way to show how accepting she was with Feuer and her sexual orientation; she has repeatedly asked about Himebaugh and sent gifts when the babies were born.
Feuer's coming-out to students was spurred by the annual Chicago Marathon. She had been training to run the event with her sister in 2007, and was fundraising for a student group that she sponsors, which raises awareness of domestic vioLence.
Many students went to the marathon, even though Feuer was not abLe to run. They cheered for Feuer's sister, who many had met.
Himebaugh was there, too.
"After the race, a few students asked who Kris was," Feuer said. "I thought I had to be honest at that point. After aLL, these are kids who trust me with a Lot of their thoughts, their ideas."
Feuer was admittedly emotionaL when she came out to students.
They were fine with a Lesbian teacher. "To them, it was Like, whatever," Feuer said.
Feuer is not part of the Lane Tech gay-straight aLLiance (GSA), mostly because of the time constraints due to her children. The Lane Tech GSA has been around for about 12 or 13 years, she said, and it was started by a straight teacher who just saw a need, she said.
Feuer estimated there are about 25 LGBT students at Lane Tech - equaLly spLit, gay and Lesbian. She recalls at Least one transgender student in recent years, though Feuer was not sure if the student had graduated.
There are about 4,500 Lane Tech students, and more than 250 teachers.
Feuer said there are other gay teachers at Lane Tech, perhaps about a dozen. One Spanish teacher, for instance, has a photo of himself and his husband on his desk.
'It's been pLeasantly surprising," she said.
