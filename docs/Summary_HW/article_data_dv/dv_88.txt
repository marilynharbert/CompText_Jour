Abstract: Affinity's constituents and donors have been a supreme pleasure to work with over the years. There are foundations that have invested in Affinity early on and for multiple years-Alphawood, Astraea, Chicago Foundation for Women, Crossroads Fund, Woods Fund of Chicago. And to be notified that Affinity was one of the grantees in the very first funding round of the Chicago Community Trust's LGBT Fund was a beautiful moment.

Full text: Â  Moving on
Dear Friends,
Today (Sept. 30) is my last day as executive director of Affinity Community Services. I don't have the words to convey how profoundly grateful I am for these past six and a half years of frantic learning, teaching in difficult moments, co-creating with leaders and constituents, walking through fire, celebrating community triumphs, enduring personal defeats, tears, laughter (lots!) and love. It has been a journey.
As I grow older, I realize that six and half years is just a blink in what I hope will be a long life. But so much has happened in that span of time. Some highlights are: graduating 12 scholars from the Youth Leadership Institute, training 43 peer advocates to discuss HIV prevention in their networks, supervising 10 interns who gained valuable nonprofit and organizing experience, hosting more than 30 cable access shows, organizing three major convenings-Beyond Marriage Equality, LGBTQ Homeless Youth Summit, At the Intersections: Race, Gender, and Sexual Orientation in Public Policy-putting together more than 20 community forums on health, intimate partner violence, financial security, immigration, community violence, best practices in serving youth, and other topics.
There were also editing or co-writing a half dozen issue papers, research reports and public statements; helping produce six Burning Bowl events; launching a group for older adults; appearing on too many panels, radio shows and public hearings to count; and working toward public policy victories like marriage equality and the extension of the African-American AIDS Response Act.
I have been blessed to work with all of Affinity's board presidents-Christina Smith, Lisa Maria Pickens, Kelly Suzanne Saulsberry and Ebonie Davis. They have been sounding boards, problem solvers, constructive critics, companions in the trenches, my sheroes and so much more. These women are evidence of the amazing changes that can happen in community when women lead.
I have also worked with some of the most inspiring organizers and organizations on the planet through the many coalitions that Affinity is an active member of and the partnerships for projects and new initiatives. There is no shortage of positive life-changing work taking place in this city.
Affinity's constituents and donors have been a supreme pleasure to work with over the years. There are foundations that have invested in Affinity early on and for multiple years-Alphawood, Astraea, Chicago Foundation for Women, Crossroads Fund, Woods Fund of Chicago. And to be notified that Affinity was one of the grantees in the very first funding round of the Chicago Community Trust's LGBT Fund was a beautiful moment. I am just as touched by the woman who has been donating $10 a month to Affinity for nearly 10 years. The love and support of our program leaders, other volunteers, loyal readers of The Weekly Download, Affinity stakeholders and those who donate their hardearned cash are the true testament to why Affinity has been around for 20 years, and is poised to stay relevant and impactful for years to come.
When I was hired, I told the board that five years might be my limit. I knew that as Affinity's first executive director I would work long hours and encounter many challenges. And I have to admit that I underestimated the many joys that have come with this labor of love. I have thought about my self-imposed five-year window many times over the last year and a half, especially when I reflected on the many things I wanted to get done before I left. But part of being a leader is knowing when your energy is waning and then stepping aside.
While we announced my departure to the community during Jazz n July, the board has actually been preparing for my transition since last year. So you need not worry about Affinity's ability to go on. Besides, it has always taken a village to keep Affinity going and that is as it should be.
I am excited about what is ahead for this organization that has been so much a part of my life for almost 10 years (including my time on the board). I am especially excited about the leadership of the current board and am sending them love and light as they begin the process of selecting a new executive director.
I am moving on to lead a new model for organizing in the LGBTQ community that will be launched the week of Oct. 7. I look forward to continuing to work with Affinity, other organizations and many friends in the ongoing battle for dignity, equity and liberation of marginalized people.
With gratitude,
Kim L. Hunt
