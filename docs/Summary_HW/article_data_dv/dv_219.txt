Abstract: The film was just 67 minutes, yet composer [Dan Studney] and lyricist [Kevin Murphy]'s musical adaptation fills out to a flabby two hours. It's about a half hour too long since Studney and Murphy's material is stuffed with caricatures instead of real characters you actually give a damn about. It also isn't nearly as clever as it should be (we don't really need yet another Jesus Christ visitation production number).

Very few off-Broadway musicals get made into full-length movies, let alone flop ones that ran less than a month. But thafs what happened with Reefer Madness: The Musical. The Showtime cable network filmed this 2001 show in 2005 as a companion piece for the launch of the pot comedy Weeds.
Reefer Madness is an adaptation of the 1936 cult film of the same name. It showed such outrageous outcomes of marijuana use that it has become a camp classic.
The film was just 67 minutes, yet composer Dan Studney and lyricist Kevin Murphy's musical adaptation fills out to a flabby two hours. It's about a half hour too long since Studney and Murphy's material is stuffed with caricatures instead of real characters you actually give a damn about. It also isn't nearly as clever as it should be (we don't really need yet another Jesus Christ visitation production number).
The weaknesses of Reefer Madness become more apparent when the ensemble performing it can't get the right campy tone to mock this tale of sunny American youths getting hooked on pot. The pert and pretty performers of ensemble 113 - under director Corey Lubowich and choreographer Rachel Freidman - do their darnedest to make the musical funny, but their inexperience shows.
This is very apparent in the casting of the corruptible pot fiends. Joseph Boersma as pusher Jack Stone, Kim Grossman as addict Mae and Elyse Ranchen as reckless mother Sally each lack the film noir tone to make their dialogue crackle with self-aware ironic humor.
Their comic timing is also way off. Boersma's scenes of domestic abuse on Mae should be cartoonish to prompt audience laughter - not the gasps of horror like on opening night.
As the wholesome high school sweethearts Jimmy Harper and Mary Lane, Will Aaron and Amy Stricker respectively do much better at creating the laughable wide-eyed naivety of their characters. Clayton Fox also has loads of fun as the Lecturer who warns the parents (but also seems to revel in playing other characters ranging from a randy satyr to a preachy FDR).
But the whole cast could ratchet up their performances with a more arch awareness of how simple the motivations are for their paltry roles. And the scene changes could be speedier (even if the tatty couch and booze bottle-filled table fit cozily in set designer Michael Bou-Maroun's platform set).
Yet these qualms with Reefer Madness and ensemble 113's so-so production of it probably won't matter much to the recreational user demographic, since it cooks up plenty of jokes to suit them. But fans of well-written musical theater will probably wish they were watching a better off-Broadway movie-musical adaptation like Little Shop of Horrors instead.
