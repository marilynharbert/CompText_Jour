Full text: Over 2,000 people gathered at the Hyatt Regency Chicago, 151 E. Wacker, on Sept. 17 to celebrate and support the Chicago Foundation for Women at its annual luncheon. The event, now in its 24th year, highlighted the many achievements the organization and its grantees have garnered as well as reiterating the need for funding for future endeavors.
The scheduled speaker, Dr. Maya Angelou, was unable to attend the event due to medical reasons, leaving a bittersweet feeling as attendees arrived to hear the news that feminist icon Gloría Steinern had agreed to take the stage instead. Steinern, who turned 75 earlier this year, addressed the eager crowd for more than 30 minutes discussing her birthday wish list, which includes an end to domestic violence; greater inclusion of positive news reporting in the numerous media outlets; a desire to see newsstands filled with erotica instead of pornography; the participation of more men in child care; and allocating the the military budget to child care and schools. Regarding the LGBT community, she said, "I want all grown-ups to be able to get married."
