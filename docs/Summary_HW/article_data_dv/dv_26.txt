Full text: Immigrant community members, state legislators and leaders with the Campaign for a Welcoming Illinois denounced Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner's vetoes of the VOICES Act (SB 34), the Immigration Safe Zones Act (SB 35), and the Immigrant Tenant Protection Act (SB 3103) recently.
The vetoes come almost exactly a year after Rauner joined community members in Chicago to sign the Illinois TRUST Act-a bill that barred state and local law enforcement from arresting and holding individuals based on immigration status or immigration warrants and detainers.
The VOICES Act, SB 34, would protect immigrant survivors of domestic violence by standardizing the process across Illinois for them to get certifications from law-enforcement agencies in order to seek federal protections. The Safe Zones Act, SB 35, would develop model policies to protect immigrants against ICE arrests at courthouses, schools, hospitals and other sensitive locations. The Immigrant Tenant Protection Act, SB 3103, would bar landlords from evicting or threatening tenants based on their actual or suspected immigration status.
Fred Tsao, senior policy counsel at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, said in a statement, "A year ago, Gov. Rauner signed the TRUST Act, yet today he announces vetoes for three bills that would make our state more welcoming. One moment he is addressing the needs of immigrant communities, and the next, he is using hateful antiimmigrant rhetoric to rationalize rejecting bills that are vital to our communities. Can immigrants really trust this governor?"
