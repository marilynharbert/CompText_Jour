Abstract: "Don't Ask, Don't TeLL" (DADT) has rightfully come under attack again. The American Medical Association recentLy voted to oppose DADT, saying the poLicy of forcing gay service members to keep their sexual orientation a secret from their physicians has a chiLLing effect on communication and is a bad Law. These conclusions are neither new nor unexpected.

"Don't Ask, Don't TeLL" (DADT) has rightfully come under attack again. The American Medical Association recentLy voted to oppose DADT, saying the poLicy of forcing gay service members to keep their sexual orientation a secret from their physicians has a chiLLing effect on communication and is a bad Law. These conclusions are neither new nor unexpected.
The rationale of prohibiting gays from serving in our miLitary forces has been consistentLy contradicted by at least three studies commissioned by the U.S. Department of Defense itself. The Crittenden Report (1957) concluded that homosexual service members did not pose a greater security risk than heterosexual personneL. According to the report, inteLLigence officers sometimes considered heterosexuaL relations more of a security threat than homosexual conduct.
The prohibition, persecution and prosecution of gays in our miLitary forces are increasingly indefensibLe in Light of a new report by education and military Leaders. An alarming 75 percent of Americans ages 17 to 24 would not qualify for military service because they are physically unfit, have criminal records, or have not finished high school.
Of course, DADT is attributabLe to vioLence as weLL, but not on Ly toward gay and Lesbian miLitary members. RecentLy, a Chicago man was charged with murdering his wife. WhiLe the crime was portrayed as domestic vioLence involving insurance money, DADT p Lay ed a rale as weLL. When the wife reportedLy discovered her husband was secretly engaged in MSM activities and threatened divorce, the husband understood that his miLitary career and pension were endangered and chose murder in response.
It's time to end DADT and aLLow gays and Lesbians to openly serve in our miLitary forces.
