Abstract: I don't know all of the issues regarding LGBT equality so I want to find out about all the issues. Why do we have to have "Don't Ask, Don't Tell?" It doesn't make sense to me since it's a type of discrimination against gays and lesbians and I think it should be abolished - but will the Senate abolish it as quickly as you are asking? I don't know.

Full text: Headnote ELECTIONS'10: GOVERNOR
Fresh from an endorsement by the National Taxpayers of Illinois, where he pledged to have tax accountability and not raise income taxes, Windy City Times met with independent Illinois gubernatorial candidate Scott Lee Cohen to talk about a variety of issues - including why he decided to run after being asked to give up being the candidate for lieutenant governor.
Windy City Times: How would you describe yourself?
Scott Lee Cohen: I see myself as an easygoing, determined, open-minded, caring, compassionate person who is fiscally conservative and socially liberal.
WCT: Why did you decide to run for governor as an independent after dropping out of the race as the lieutenant governor candidate for the Democratic ticket?
SLC: I put my heart and soul into running for lieutenant governor. When the Democratic Party went against me it crushed me because all I wanted to do was help the people. When I stepped down I started getting phone calls and e-mails. People were coming to my house and knocking on my door. The consensus among friends and strangers was that the Democratic Party had no right to take away their vote.
The people of Illinois are hurting and I had something to offer with my business and life experience. This state does not need perfection; it needs honesty and transparency, which I have to offer. I was totally honest about my life so I listened to the people. I'm thinking about why I ran and for me to just step down and not run. It would be just like Jack Ryan or Blair Hull, who never got involved in politics again. Most importantly, I had the desire to run, which is why I got back into the race.
WCT: What was your reaction when numerous top Illinois Democratic politicians called for you to withdraw from the lieutenant governor's race?
I was hurt and crushed because the Democratic Party led me to believe that the people of Illinois hated me, which wasn't true. They were a little confused but they didn't hate me. They admired my honesty and they believed in me as a person.
WCT: Do you feel that your candidacy will take votes away from your former running mate, Gov. Quinn? If no, then why not?
SLC: Forty-six percent of the people of Illinois are independent voters, and the reason why they have not voted for anyone other than a Republican or a Democrat is because there hasn't been a candidate that they wanted to vote for. Now I believe there is a candidate they can vote for because I will be pulling from both the Democrats and Republicans.
WCT: What was it that you liked about Gov. Quinn that made you want to run as lieutenant governor with him?
SLC: Nothing, since we didn't run together - but my view was that, as lieutenant governor, I would have the authority and the power to bring businesses back to Illinois through the Illinois Main Street program. At the time, Illinois was going to lose that program due to lack of interest. I knew I would be his partner and it didn't mean that I liked him. When Gov. Quinn told me he was going to cut the budget and take away any of the responsibilities of the lieutenant governor's so I'm thinking without any power how am I going to help the people of Illinois. I am not the type of person who can take a paycheck and do nothing because that to me is like lying and cheating. I can't do it so I said forget it I am done.
WCT: Would your objectives be achieved in other ways than running for governor?
SLC: No, and here is why: In order to move Illinois forward and in order to bring businesses and jobs back to Illinois Bill Brady can't do it and neither can Gov. Quinn. They have never been successful businessmen. They don't know what it is like for a businessman to struggle to meet payroll, work within a budget, make appropriate budget cuts and spend wisely. I could have helped small groups but that was not my plan; I want to help everyone in Illinois by bringing the jobs back and putting people back to work. I want to bring hope and prosperity back to this state because we haven't seen it in at least a decade.
WCT: You support strict enforcement of the new hate-crimes law. Can you tell me your positions on ENDA [the Employment NonDiscrimination Act] and marriage equality for same-sex couples as well as repealing "Don't Ask, Don't Tell?" Also, do you support the right of same-sex binational couples having the same immigration rights as straight couples have? What about HIV/ AIDS funding?
SLC: I believe these hate crimes have got to end. I am a strong advocate for the LGBT community. It blows my mind that Quinn, who is a Democrat, doesn't do enough to help the community. He really doesn't, but he talks a good game with regards to LGBT equality.
On the issue of ENDA people can't discriminate based on sexual orientation- just like they shouldn't discriminate on any other factors. I am a small-business owner and there are people who work for me who are openly gay. I have never discriminated against anyone in my life and I feel that it's not OK for anyone to discriminate against the LGBT community - not just in Illinois but anybody across the USA.
On marriage equality I am 110 percent for civil unions and I believe... Listen, if it were up to me, I would say same-sex marriage is fine; I have no problem with it and let's go for it. I think that getting same-sex marriage passed through the legislature is going to be an uphill battle, but I'm not saying it will never happen. I am talking to you honestly and I would sign any bill that came across my desk to allow for samesex marriages. [However,] until we get to that point I think it's important for same-sex couples to share the benefits, and they aren't getting them. You can't get family leave if someone dies and you are in a same-sex relationship so there is no equality there. So civil unions, until we get to same-sex marriage, allows for insurance benefits and family leave.
I don't know all of the issues regarding LGBT equality so I want to find out about all the issues. Why do we have to have "Don't Ask, Don't Tell?" It doesn't make sense to me since it's a type of discrimination against gays and lesbians and I think it should be abolished - but will the Senate abolish it as quickly as you are asking? I don't know. There are still some old-time politicians who aren't open-minded, and you know that they are a part of the problem that Illinois is having today.
I support the right for same-sex binational couples to have equal immigration rights as straight binational couples already have.
As for HIV/AIDS funding it should be funded more but the state is broke, so for me to sit here as a candidate and say that if elected I am going to give you $100 million would be a lie. I will tell you this: I won't cut any of the funding. I have to do my audit and when I know where my money is going I can reallocate funding by getting rid of some programs that are redundant and outdated and reallocate funds to what is important in today's society. I am not cutting the funding for HIV/AIDS patients drug access.
WCT: Are you holding any fundraisers geared specifically for the LGBT community?
SLC: I have tried to reach out to a couple of organizations and they would not meet with me. It's because I am an independent and it's not just LGBT organizations that have refused to meet with me. I have gotten resistance from other organizations due to my independent status.
WCT: What are your thoughts on education, including funding?
SLC: I was very upset when the Illinois Education Association endorsed Quinn because here is a man who cuts education spending by $310 million and, in the same week, turns around and give his staff raises. You can't do that.
I was walking in the Gay Pride parade and you know it's a very crowded parade. I heard someone screaming my name and she runs out and said, "Mr. Cohen please talk with me for a moment?" I walked over and she [said], "Sorry to bother you but I am a teacher and I have over 32 students in my class. I love teaching but I can't teach when I have this many students." I gave her my card and said you are preaching to the choir so call me. However, when that same incident happened to Quinn he wouldn't talk to the lady at all. I want to sit down with the teachers and hear from them what works and what doesn't work and come up with a plan.
I want to know why so many kids get passed to the next grades that are illiterate. What is the point of all this testing when students can't even read and write properly? I say go to school and learn all the subjects because I get test score after test score on my kid and what are we doing all of this for? So that schools can get funding from the feds? Illinois education funding was cut by $100 million by the federal government so why wasn't Gov. Quinn on a plane to Washington D. C. screaming at the President about this. Illinois is the President's hometown and he is going to take money away from the children? If Quinn had demanded an answer something better would have come out of that. This is what it takes.
WCT: What are your thoughts regarding a high school geared specifically for LGBT students, similar to the Harvey Milk High School in New York City?
SLC: An LGBT person should be integrated into society. If we put them into a school with only LGBT kids, isn't that saying there is something wrong with them? That is the message that a specific school aimed at LGBT students would send to the public. [However,] I would support an LGBT high school if students and parents wanted one.
WCT: What about bullying in schools?
SLC: My youngest son is very heavy and his confidence is shattered because of all the bullying he gets so, yes, I am a big advocate for anti-bullying laws. Gov. Quinn can sign a million laws on the books but he has to have the ability to implement these laws by rolling up his sleeves and seeing that these laws are carried out, which is what I would do if elected. Also, educating the adults involved - including teachers, principals, support staff, parents and community leaders - about the effects of bullying is key, and I say this as someone who was bullied in school myself.
WCT: What are your comments on the upcoming Chicago mayoral race now that Mayor Daley has decided to retire?
SLC: I was shocked and a little sad that Daley decided to step down because he was the mayor for over 20 years and has done many good things for the city. Unfortunately, he is only going to be remembered for two things: selling the parking meters and the skyway. He was the only Democrat that stood up and said I was honest and to let me run for office.
WCT: How do you feel about term limits?
SLC: I'm all for two terms for both state and local offices, but if you are a good leader and not a crook you should be able to run for office after going back to the private sector following your two terms in office.
WCT: What if politicians want to atone?
SLC: People are tired ofthat and you should be given one chance and if you mess up again then you should get out of politics.
WCT: How do you reconcile what you say are your campaign goals (i.e., ethics) with the allegations (e.g., domestic abuse against women) that have been levied against you?
SLC: What the people heard were half-truths and lies, and if we continue to focus on the past we will never bring any issue forward.
Now, with the exception of the media, no one has asked me about my past. People know that when you are in a relationship including a divorce things are said and done that aren't true and I will tell you this: I was always honest with the people of Illinois. I had a constitutional right to expunge and seal all of my records so that none of this would have been known but for me to do that and turn around and say I'm going to lead Illinois in an honest and transparent way would be a lie. That's why I never sealed anything because I wanted the people to see it and make up their own minds.
WCT: Why do you think you can win?
SLC: I can absolutely win this election. People are tired of the career politicians who have worked hard to dig us a hole, a $14 billion deficit and 10-percent unemployment. They haven't worked hard to get us out of it and until we elect a new face with fresh ideas and a fresh perspective Illinois will not get back on the right road. We have the resources to get the message out and I am thankful and humbled by the amount of support I am getting from people of Illinois. I believe that together we can win this election.
WCT: Is there anything else you would like to say to the readers of Windy City Times?
SLC: I want the LGBT community to know that as we talked about earlier in this interview that I myself have been discriminated against in many different areas - for being Jewish, for being an independent candidate, for being honest. As governor I will have an open-door policy for the LGBT [community] that I would not only want but would welcome members of the community to sit down with me, to be a part of an advisory board or steering community, to make life better, safer and to help me be able to help them.
