"98","dv_5.txt","After traveling to the Big Cat Rescue in Florida myself, I noticed how small-and far away from the public-the cages were located. In the program, owner Carole Baskin makes the case that the park is helping abused and abandoned big cats while charging customers to enter. If this is true, then she is making a killing along the way, after starting the project in 1992. Baskin is a fascinating character in Tiger King; she was ahead of the curve in terms of social media and even made a virtual-reality zoo last year. Is she a gentle animal lover or an evil genius who killed her husband in some way? These are questions that have both hooked viewers and have resulted in a new investigation against her.","5.

"100","dv_5.txt","Lovers of animals have been skittish about watching the series, although another doc- Don't F**k With Cats: Hunting An Internet Killer, on the same platform-is much tougher to watch. The focus is mainly on the human subjects, and that's where Tiger King only scratches the surface of the real problem. While it can be fun to see the eccentric and vengeful cast of characters in Tiger King, the series really lost sight of being about the animals. Don't worry ""all you cool cats and kittens,"" there's still meat on the bone, with a storyline of misused employees and an underworld of crime. The creators of Tiger King didn't complete everything they set out to do, but they have made a highly watchable tiger tale that is must-see TV.","5.

Organized by Keisa Reynolds of the University of Illinois at Chicago's (UIC's) Women's Leadership and Resource Center as part of its ""Take Back the Fight"" programming, Reynolds was inspired by reading a piece about how #metoo was not benefitting Black women, and realizing the author seemed unfamiliar with Black women's crucial efforts in the fight against sexual violence.","20.

The cops were never the first thing survivors asked for, she said, often because they didn't want their partners incarcerated.

"884","dv_20.txt","Through her work with social service agencies, Caidor began to see the way conversations about domestic violence and rape were siloed, and among women of color, survivor identity was still developing. Working as a counselor in Logan Square, she found she ""had to unlearn what they were taught,"" as clients treated her space more as a community center rather than for counseling. Caidor found that communities were already doing the healing and organizing she was supposed to provide.

Furthermore, she found her task literally impossible because of the belief that funding should be spread equally throughout the state. And the conversation about rape was historically understood to be private in Black communities, although the panel agreed that approaches to that conversation are changing. Scott-Boria's granddaughter has followed in her footsteps as an anti-rape organizer, unaware that her grandmother once did the same work, and her 13-year-old grandson recently asked her to explain rape.

"1694","dv_34.txt","Abstract: Dati said the assault also led to more abusive situations, including the one with his first male partner. In 2014, he wrote his memoir, I Am Me, detailing the abuse he endured and its impacts and he began doing public speaking engagements to talk about his experiences. Dati, who lives in Chicago, regularly speaks to youth at the Center on Halstead and has previously led discussions with the Chicago Police Department on intimate partner violence and how it uniquely impacts men and LGBT victims. Denise Brown, eldest sister of the late Nicole Brown Simpson, formed The Elite Speakers Bureau in 2010 to bring awareness and provide education on domestic violence, school safety, child abuse, teen violence, elder abuse, stalking, net crimes, workplace violence, victims of crime, sexual assault, mental health & wellness and more. Dati is also working on a second book, which he said is focused on the impacts of intimate partner violence and domestic violence on mental health.","34.

Second, we are in a time now where we must lift all boats. All means all. If funds are being cut to all domestic violence services in Illinois, we need a statewide call to action and fundraising.

They must now look to expand this social justice mission to other areas where they can have influence-which is almost everywhere. Now that corporations are ""people,"" they have a much louder voice in politics, and we as consumers can pressure them to use that voice for good (while at the same time fighting the notion that they are people!).

""In a lot of cases where a news outlet misreports the gender of a victim of violence, there is at least enough evidence to raise concerns about whether the gender identification given by the police department should be taken at face value. We've seen that a lot this year, where news outlets noted in police reports that the victim was dressed in a way that was atypical for their gender or went by a name that wasn't their birth name, or was referred to by friends and loved ones and by themselves on social media using gender markers or names that weren't in alignment with police reports.

"3472","dv_63.txt","I spent formative years of my life afraid to go home. I worked doubly hard in school because it was the only place in my life where people were supportive of me and my interests. I lived in fear. I carried all of my valued possessions with me in my car so that I could escape if it got too bad. I worried I would not be able to tell when it was too bad. An overwhelming anxiety loomed over me as I slept in that beat-up Chevy. I drove myself to college like a person on the run. I had panic attacks when I thought about going back home, so I didn't. I got another part-time job and stayed in an illegal apartment. During breaks, I housesat for professors, crashed friends' holiday celebrations, and found summer jobs that provided boarding.","63.

"3473","dv_63.txt","Fast forward to this summer. I was riding home on the blue line after a harrowing visit with my family. I was exhausted when a wave of relaxation swept over my whole body. I felt, for the first time, that I was going to be okay. I had clung to that fear and anxiety even as I moved thousands of miles away. I had spent years projecting self-confidence and talking up my experiences as youthful adventure seeking. In reality, no matter how much I tried to convince myself that I was fine, it always felt precarious, like I was on the precipice of crisis and any wrong move could send me plummeting into it. Somehow I had found my way into the safest home I had ever known with roommates and friends and a partner to greet me.","63.
