Abstract: For Griffin Theatre's American premiere of Stephens' working-class British drama, director Jonathan Berry and set designer Marianna Czaszar wallow in bleakness: Secondhand chairs with torn upholstery are strewn about the stage like a bombed-out antique shop.

A sense of decay pervades Simon Stephens' 2006 Olivier Award-winning drama On the Shore of the Wide World. Or the play's overall mood could reflect the need for constant rebuilding after irreversible personal cataclysms.
For Griffin Theatre's American premiere of Stephens' working-class British drama, director Jonathan Berry and set designer Marianna Czaszar wallow in bleakness: Secondhand chairs with torn upholstery are strewn about the stage like a bombed-out antique shop.
Yet there's a metaphorical bright light from the fact that two characters are historic preservation specialists. The surroundings and characters' emotional states may look trashed to hell, but Stephens hints at the potential for revitalization and betterment.
This dichotomy is assumingly what Stephens is getting at by showing three generations of the Holmes family thrashing it out in the northern English town of Stockport. Life carries on despite shattered dreams, family tragedies and smash-ups over domestic violence, drugs and infidelity.
For many, Stephens' depiction of everyday British life in the 21st century will infuriate for being too mundane and too long for its own good. Another flaw is Stephens' handling of a characters shocking death, which is introduced like an afterthought.
Another deterrent comes from the fact that the cast all make strong stabs at the characters' thick Northern English dialects. If you never tune into the BBC, you'll long for subtitles.
Yet Stephens packs a lot of challenging acting moments for Griffin's mostly strong ensemble. Director Berry stages the whole show fluidly and effectively.
On the Shore... is an ensemble piece, but the people who get the juiciest dramatic moments are the parents Peter and Alice. In these respective roles, Paul D'Addario and Elise Kauzlaric are utterly convincing as a couple who has drifted apart and consider others for solace when tragedy strikes.
Brian Deneen is utterly genuine as their lanky 18-year-old teenage son, Alex. So is Josh Schecter as the randy 15-year-old son Christopher, who has the hots for his brother's pillpopping girlfriend Sarah Black (a compellingly sarcastic Lucy Carapetyan).
Norm Woodel brings panache to the violent and drunk grandfather Charlie. By contrast, Ariel Brennens turn as Gran Ellen feels underplayed and undefined.
The rest of the cast make essentially cameo appearances that are spot-on. Christopher Chmelik is perfectly hilarious as Paul, Alex and Sarah's drug-dealing pyromaniac friend, while Karyn Morris milks the laughs and poignancy as the pregnant editor Susan Reynolds. Ian Novak's handsome turn as John Robinson also makes a compelling case for the adulterous subplot.
On the Shore... may drag on too long with too much British reserve for most tastes. But it's also an insightful examination of everyday British family life, which will please any Anglophile not exclusively bound to period dramas.
