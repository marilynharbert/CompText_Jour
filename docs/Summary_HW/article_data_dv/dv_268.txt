Abstract: It's hard talking about sexuality and [other issues] because I come from a Christian family background. Me becoming an exotic entertainer-I had no idea that this [career] was something that was already in my family. I thought, "I'm seeing Mom dance, and I'm seeing Chippendales dance," but even after I wrote the book, my grandmother sat me down for two to three hours and said, "This is no mistake." Nobody wanted to tell me what was going on.

Domestic violence, sexual experimentation, relationships, date rape, steroid use and suicide are just some of the topics covered in Tahjaleenie "Mega Body" Tahji's book G-String Dreams: True Confessions of a Male Exotic Dancer. Before talking at the April 3 Chicago Black Gay Men's Caucus (CBGMC) forum "Sex and Eroticism," Tahji discussed bisexuality, dancing and HIV/AIDS with Windy City Times.
Windy City Times: You cover so much in this book. Why share all of this with the public?
Tahjaleenie Tahji: Well, I've been through so much as a human being, a man and as an entertainer. I'm glad to be at the stage where I am now, [but] I'm tired of people asking me certain questions. Also, this gives me an opportunity to educate my children; I want them to know what the real world is like.
It's hard talking about sexuality and [other issues] because I come from a Christian family background. Me becoming an exotic entertainer-I had no idea that this [career] was something that was already in my family. I thought, "I'm seeing Mom dance, and I'm seeing Chippendales dance," but even after I wrote the book, my grandmother sat me down for two to three hours and said, "This is no mistake." Nobody wanted to tell me what was going on. I'm finding out that a whole chapter is missing from my book.
WCT: I was going to save that question until the end, but I'll ask it now: Was there anything you don't have in this book that you wish you had included?
TT: Just the realness of what my mom's and dad's [lives] were. I wish they had told me the truth: that they had done what [I do]. My dad brushed it off as ballroom dancing. [My parents] didn't really walk me through the journey of same-sex relationships and all that stuff. It was more like, "When are you going to get out of that?"
WCT: So both of your parents were dancers?
TT: Yes. My grandmother sat me down and explained it to me. My [parents] and my dad's mother used to be female exotic dancers. I asked her why no one told me this before and she said, "Because you became more successful than anyone else who did it in the family. ... You went further than anyone else; you went on national television and now you're an author. I believe that your mom and dad are jealous of you." I thought that maybe it's true, [but] maybe it isn't.
WCT: I thought you were going to say that maybe your parents were trying to protect you.
TT: No; I don't see my mom and dad trying to protect me [from] this entertainment industry. At first, they didn't seem all that shocked and they were happy that the money was coming in. That's one thing I learned about family: When you're doing well, they all start coming at you. As soon as you hit rock bottom, no one wants to talk to you.
[That being said,] one of the biggest inspirations in writing this book was to say to everybody, "Regardless of what happens to you, don't give up on your dreams. Your dream is your dream." I enjoy the exotic [dancing] world, but there's no big future in it; there are no contracts or endorsements.
There are a lot of deep things in this book, such as domestic violence and HIV/AIDS. I'm blessed in that, after 13 years in this industry, I'm HIV-negative, but I could have been positive. I could've just been out there wildin' out.
WCT: How prevalent would you say HIV/ AIDS is within the exotic-dancing industry?
TT: It's not known because no one is saying anything. I know that after my friend, Sensational, died in New York that no one said anything. We really do not promote any shows that raise awareness about [HIV/AIDS]. I try to put condoms in people's hands [where I'm entertaining], and a lot of women are like, "Condoms. Wow. What am I supposed to do with this?" Some women took it as a good thing; others took it as a bad thing. A lot of religious folk are upset about condoms because, if we give them to teenagers, they see it that we're giving teenagers a green light [to have sex].
WCT: How much longer do you think you'll dance?
TT: I'm getting into acting and the recording business; I admire rappers like LL Cool J and Will Smith, who don't use terms like "bitch" and "ho." My daughter would be like, "Daddy, why did you have to say that?"
As for dancing, I'm still able to do it. [Tahji is 41.] I enjoy it, but there's a lot of wear and tear because I [physically] pick up a lot of men and women. But my dream is to have a microphone in my hand and [rapping]. I also want to continue writing books.
