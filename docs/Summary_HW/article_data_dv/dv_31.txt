SPECIAL VISIBILITY AWARDS
DYLAN GEICK
Dylan Geick, 18, has only been an openly gay member of the LGBTQ community for a year now, and it's been the best year of his life. He was an all-American and all-state-winning wrestler at Stevenson High School, compiling an 86-8 record.
"I didn't realize how connected and supportive the LGBT community is," Dylan told Windy City Times in a March profile. "From the moment I came out, there was outreach from so many people, [offering] guidance and advice. It surprised me how much people cared in a positive way, how much they really wanted to help me.
"To the kids in the closet who are worried [about coming out], there is such a huge community that wants to help, and that was pretty surprising to me."
Did you know? Dylan is now committed to attend Columbia University and will wrestle in Division I.
ADAM DAVIES
Adam Davies, 19, grew up in Appleton, Wisconsin.
He is currently an undergraduate student at Northwestern University studying biology and aocial policy. He hopes to continue on to be a university professor and pursue research involving the transgender community.
At Northwestern, Adam has two main passions: speaking out against sexual violence and
advocating for transgender students. Adam is a vocal survivor presence on campus where he has
spoken multiple times about the intersections of queer identities and sexual assault.
In response to a letter written by the dean of students that Adam felt halfheartedly pledged to assist transgender students, he realized it was time to take action to make the university accountable to be a safe space for its transgender community. He currently works closely with University administration and staff in order to achieve gender-affirming healthcare, restroom facilities and correct pronoun usage for all students.
He hopes that, in the future, transgender students who go to Northwestern will not have to face the
struggles he did and can be empowered to be leaders for the transgender community. In addition, he hopes to assist Northwestern in becoming an example for other schools on how to provide
necessary resources for their transgender students.
Did you know? Adam performs on campus as his amateur drag character-" Dick NU" (pronounced "in you")-actively mocking ideas of toxic masculinity at Northwestern.
ARTEM KOLESOV
Artem Kolesov, 23, is originally from Saint Petersburg, Russia.
He began his violin studies at the age of 6 with renowned violinist Natalya Maximenko; he soon after was launched as a young prodigious talent and performed throughout Russia. Later, Artem went on to study with Professor Irina Chichina. At 12, he won first prize at the International Violin Competition in Tallinn, Estonia. Thereafter, he took first prize at the Freiburg International Violin Competition in Germany and was awarded a government prize as the most outstanding young violinist in Saint Petersburg, Russia (2009). He has performed several times as a soloist with the renowned Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra. One of those performances was recorded, and at the age of 16 Artem was invited to study with Philippe Djokic at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. Artem now lives in Chicago and studies violin with Almita Vamos.
In March 2017 Artem came out to his family, and later posted a video on YouTube where he shared his experience of growing up gay in a Pentecostal family. His coming-out story was published by BuzzFeed, CNN, NPR, Windy City Times and other media outlets in order to highlight the issue of treatment of the LGBT community in Russia and Chechnya.
Did you know? Due to an anti-gay propaganda law, Artem's coming-out video put him at risk of arrest if he returns to Russia.
SPECIAL JOURNALIST AWARD
LIZ BAUDLER
Liz Baudler, 26, never thought she'd be a journalist-her degree from Columbia College Chicago is in fiction writing.
However, Liz realized she was decades from writing a novel and started talking to authors instead; occasionally, that's earned her money. She joined Windy City Times as a freelance writer in 2014. Career highlights include stories about LGBTQ health and psychology as well as interviewing musician Amanda Palmer. Liz also co-hosts Sappho's Salon, a monthly performance series at Women and Children First Bookstore for women, trans and non-binary artists, and has told stories herself at Outspoken, Loose Chicks and Fillet of Solo, among others.
Currently, Liz works with the National LGBT Media Association, a coalition of 12 regional LGBT newspapers of which Windy City Times is a member. This helps her indulge her loves of social media, journalism and LGBTQ history. From 2013 to 2016, Liz delivered lectures on current and past LGBTQ scientists at both Columbia College and Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry. Her future plans include sharpening her journalism skills by covering LGBTQ advertising and marketing, reading lots of queer writing and publishing her poetry chapbook.
