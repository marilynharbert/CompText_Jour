Full text: By now, everyone should have received a mailing from the U.S. Census Bureau to get counted. I have complicated feelings about the census.
While the census is critically important to ensure a fair allocation of funding for services and political representation, it will not deliver the full acceptance and freedom of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community. After all, it's a government survey. It will not capture the breadth of human experience in America today. So why are my feelings about it " complicated?
If s about me and who I am
Some aspects of my identity are reflected in the census. I'm gay. There is no census question asking about sexual orientation. Yet, the relationship question counts same-sex married spouses and unmarried partners. While being a same-sex couple is a poor proxy for sexual orientation, the 2010 census uncovered more than 700,000 same-sex couples in the United States.
I'm a dad of an adopted African-American child. Many LGBTQ people build families through adoption. The census counts transracial families. In fact, every year census data is used to allocate $8 Billion for foster care and adoption assistance that can help queers start families.
But it doesn't reflect my community
At the same time, my community is erased. Trans and gender non-conforming people must respond to a binary sex question. They must choose between their sex assigned at birth or how they identity to-day. The census asks about biology, not identity, and today while Facebook has more than 52 genders, the U.S. government only has two. It sucks.
Even India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Washington and Oregon states recognize a third gender. I and my organization, the National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance (NQAPIA), have urged the Census Bureau to recognize all of our community.
If s critically important
In the midst of the C0-VID 19 pandemic, health care is especially critical. The census is used to allocate $311 Billion in medical assistance annually, according to the George Washington University Institute for Public Policy. More resources flow to where there is greater need based on the relative size of the population.
I teach a class on Asian American queerness at Hunter College CUNY. So many of my students benefit from the $29 billion in financial aid (Pell Grants) for college every year.
I came out in the 1980s, at the height of the AIDS crisis. When I was in ACT UP, I fought hard to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. The census continues to be used to allocate $645 Million in HIV funding.
I could go on and recount the importance of an accurate census:
-$457 million for community mental health services
-$133 million for domestic violence prevention programs that guard against same-sex intimate-partner violence
-$48 million for community arts programs and for queer and trans artists
-$4.7 mMillion to prevent abuse, neglect and exploitation of elders
The more people who respond to the Census, the more likely resources will flow to under-resourced communities.
If s about political power and influence
But for me the most important aspect of the Census is the political influence that the data drives. The census can be a check on the outsized political influence that some intolerant states command when apportioning congressional seats among the states based on population.
Census data is also used to redraw Congressional, State Legislative and City Council district boundaries to make them equal in population. Sure, some districts can be gerrymandered. But voting rights advocates can also use the data to draw districts that give communities of color, and those who have be traditionally underrepresented, a voice in the halls of power.
If s mandatory and ensuring safety
The census is required by law. People can be fined $100 for not responding. Federal law also ensures that personal information is private and may not be shared with the immigration service, IRS, or law enforcement.
I am a lawyer. I reviewed the law and was delighted to find that the confidentiality protections have been upheld and strengthened by the courts. Yet, even in light of the strict penalties for those who violate the protections, I am still concerned.
NQAPIA is monitoring the census to keep our community safe. We have lawyers ready to sue if there are breaches and who are available to answer questions. You can report problem to us at http://bit. ly/2ULyiLy.
The way I see it, getting LGBTQ people to participate in the census is ultimately about harm reduction. The data collected inherently underrepresents the multiplicity of our identities. It can feel reductive and often dehumanizing, but it is necessary because of the very real implications towards how the government will allocate resources and representation. The census holds a lasting impact. To be missed is to be gone for the next ten years.
Let's be counted.

Full text: A report published by Chicago's Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law shows that while coverage of the incidence of sexual abuse in Chicago Public Schools has spurred critical dialogue around how school officials respond to students who've experienced gender-based violence, there are widespread blind spots to domestic and sexual violence in schools all over Illinois.
The report underscores the what it calls current inadequacies in Illinois schools that can hold student survivors back. Among the report's findings:
-Most schools lack a written policy or customary protocol for school personnel to deal with revelations of domestic and sexual violence.
-Despite a 2007 Illinois law requiring training for teachers, guidance counselors, and other school personnel likely to deal with students who've survived domestic and sexual violence, training is not taking place.
-School personnel often respond inappropriately to vulnerable students who disclose their experiences, and breach confidentially by publicly sharing details of students' experiences.
-School officials' inexpert responses result in intrusive questioning and peer bullying of survivors.
-Many student survivors are left to fend for themselves in the wake of their trauma and, as a result, miss classes, move schools or drop out.
The report's findings are based on four focus groups and 31 in-person and phone interviews conducted in 2015 and 2016; a total of 59 students (middle school and high school students) and service providers participated. The participants were diverse in terms of race, ethnicity and LGBTQ status; in addition, the participant service providers served diverse student populations.
The report calls for all K-12 schools across Illinois to develop survivor-centered, traumainformed policies for responding to the needs of students who are survivors of domestic or sexual violence.

Full text: Center on Halsted (the Center) and the UN Women Chicago chapter hosted a panel discussion, "Cultural Stigma of LGBTQ Domestic Violence," Oct. 4 at the Center to kick off its programming slate for Domestic Violence Awareness Month.
Panelists included American Indian Health Service of Chicago Youth Programs & Youth Social Work Director Lauren Miller; Domestic Violence Legal Clinic Staff Attorney and Invisible 2 Invincible: Asian/Pacific Islander Pride of Chicago (i2i) member Nebula Li; and Radhika Sharma Gordon, outreach and education manager for Apna Ghar, a services and advocacy group for immigrant communities dedicated to ending gender violence. The Center's Anti-Violence Project (AVP) Clinical Advocate Caitlin Tupper served as the event's moderator.
Tupper asked what stigmas and barriers each of the panelists encounter with the people they serve who are victims of domestic violence.
Sharma Gordon said there is a fear of coming forward due to many factors, including being undocumented, family shaming and the older generation not wanting to air their dirty laundry versus the younger generation.
Li explained that sometimes LGBTQ-identified domestic violence victims are not out to their parents or other family members; queer couples are most often in the same social group; and there are not a lot of services outside of the Center which makes it harder for people in faraway neighborhoods to get help.
Miller, who identifies as pansexual and is a member of the Mvsoke-Creek Native American tribe, said that the Native American population has the most instances of domestic violence and sexual assault per capita, but the statistics for queer people within that group are unclear. She explained that only 40 tribes acknowledge LGBTQ people in their individual Constitutions, so it is difficult for many queer Native people to be out about their sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
In terms of people's coming out challenges, Tupper questioned how each of their organizations are combating that issue.
Miller said they have a youth drop-in center and a website page dedicated to youth programming, while Li explained that at the Domestic Violence Legal Clinic they will be doing a Trans 101 session for staff this fall.
Sharma Gordon said her organization has worked to have the staff "check their biases at the door" so everyone who comes in their door will receive the same level of services. She explained that another way they show their inclusivity is with an LGBTQIA poster featuring many different languages that says, "Welcome here" that a former staffer made for their space.
Every panelist emphasized the urgency of assisting trans and gender nonconforming women of color that come to them for help, including providing them with safe spaces to share their stories. Miller spoke about her organization's recent move to the corner of Montrose and Lowell Avenues, where they will have gender neutral bathrooms.
Tupper asked about the dynamics of domestic violence where partners exert control that they see in their work.
Miller said that the victim is sometimes shunned by their tribe, including removing access to cultural practices. Li explained that there is often a language barrier where the victim is not allowed to learn English as well as the desire to not ruin the reputation of all Asians by reporting acts of domestic violence. Sharma Gordon spoke about immigration status being tied to marriage to one's abuser.
As far as a safety plan for LGBTQ domestic abuse survivors is concerned, Miller explained that validating their experience is key and respecting how they identify themselves is also important. Li said ensuring a survivor's confidentiality, and letting them lead the decision-making process- including using the same language they use to describe what happened to them-is also vital.

Full text: Christa Leigh Steele-Knudslien was the first known transgender person to be killed in 2018. The 42-year-old was arguing with her husband, Mark Steel-Knudslien, when he stabbed and beat her to death. Christa was the founder of the Miss Trans America and Miss Trans New England pageants. Her friend, Justin, told NBC News that she wanted trans women to be seen as beautiful.
Since her murder, at least 15 more trans people have been killed in the United States. The latest were Sasha Garden, 27, of Orlando, Florida, and Diamond Stephens, 39, of Meridian, Mississippi.
We are in the midst of a crisis. Transgender people, especially trans women of color, are at an extremely high risk of violence. Last year, the Human Rights Campaign reported a record number of violence-based deaths of trans people: 28. The violence is not relenting.
Through an examination of data and conversations with experts, this investigative feature explores the threats trans and gender nonconforming people face every day. It investigates the motivations behind this violence and the identities of the perpetrators and the victims. It examines the cultural norms that have allowed so many trans people to live in danger for so long, and it addresses the information we still don't have. Finally, it acknowledges that change isn't possible overnight, but it is possible.
The Seeds of Violence
Why are trans people at such high risk of violence? There is no single answer, but experts say the seeds of this violence lie within the cultural and systemic devaluation of transgender lives and bodies.
"Ultimately, there aren't enough people that value and respect the humanity of other folks, especially trans folks and especially trans women of color," said Angelica D'Souza, the LGBTQ & Hate Crime Victim Specialist with the Cook County State's Attorney's Office. "At the end of the day, you're not going to perpetrate violence against somebody that you value as a person. That's the fundamental problem."
This lack of value our culture has for trans people is perpetuated through the basic rights we regularly deny them-like jobs, housing and healthcare.
The unemployment rate for trans respondents to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey was 15%, compared to a then 5% unemployment rate for the general U.S. population. In addition, 29% of respondents were living in poverty, compared to 12% of the general U.S. population, and 23% experienced housing discrimination within a year of the survey while 30% said they have been homeless at some point in their lives.
The survey also showed that 33% of respondents who visited a doctor within a year of the survey had a negative experience due to being transgender, and 23% did not visit a doctor when they needed to due to fear of mistreatment. In 2015, the Movement Advancement Project found that 15% of trans people earn less than $10,000 per year.
The continuous denial of basic rights for trans people not only maintains the stigma surrounding them, but it also physically places them in more danger by blocking their access to safe places to work, live and sleep. Twenty six percent of those who experienced homelessness within a year of the survey did not go to a shelter due to fear of mistreatment based on their gender identity, and 70% of those who sought refuge at a shelter said they were mistreated because they were transgender.
Lisa Gilmore, a licensed clinical professional counselor who focuses on LGBTQ-specific antiviolence, works from the theory that "the more social stigma somebody faces, the higher their vulnerability to violence and the lower their access to safety is. If we don't provide people with shelter and safety they are going to be more vulnerable to more severe violence and death," she said.
Trans people seeking refuge from an abusive partner or who are kicked out of their homes often have nowhere to turn. "They end up on the street or staying in the relationship," Gilmore said. "They're going to be at a higher risk for violence. When you're out and about all the time and doing what you have to do to survive, you are at risk for violence, you are at risk for people thinking you are less than somehow, therefore it is easier."
LaSaia Wade, founder and executive director of Brave Space Alliance, the first Black-led, transled, LGBTQ center on Chicago's South Side, believes people's discomfort with her Black, transgender body is a projection of their discomfort with their own bodies.
"What is it about my body that makes you so uncomfortable about your body?" Wade asked. "Is it because I'm living my truth and you're not living your truth? People don't want to look in their own mirror."
Wade believes people are afraid of being true to themselves. "People don't want to sit with that these days. That is not only killing my people, but it's killing everyone else. It's killing people leftand right and it's sure as hell fucking up this country."
Types of Violence
Trans people are at risk of many types of violence, but intimate partner violence (IPV) is one huge issue the community faces.
The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey found that 54% of respondents experienced IPV, with 24% having experienced severe physical violence at the hands of an intimate partner. This is 6% higher than the general U.S. population. Additionally, the 2016 National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs Intimate Partner Violence Report found that "Transgender women were 2.5 times more likely to be stalked, 2.5 times more likely to experience financial violence, and 2 times more likely to experience online harassment within IPV, compared to survivors who were not transgender women."
Even with IPV, though, anti-transgender bias can be involved. "I don't think violence against trans women is anything other than bias motivated," said D'Souza. "Because even when there are instances of domestic violence, from the folks that I've worked with I've heard things like, 'I outed him,' 'He got violent because people found out about who I was and that was unacceptable to him.' Or, 'no one was supposed to find out about me.' Or it's about toxic masculinity and it's about patriarchy and it's about all of those things and at the end of the day it often is because of this person's identity in one way or another."
According to Forge, a national transgender anti-violence organization, there are many abuse tactics used specifically against trans people in instances of intimate partner violence, such as threatening to out someone, hiding or throwing away hormones, and belittling their identity by telling them they are not a "real" woman or man. Additionally, what makes trans victims of IPV so vulnerable is their lack of access to services that could save them from their situation as well as the common fear of involving law enforcement.
In the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, 22% of people who visited a domestic violence shelter, a domestic violence program, or a rape crisis center at which the staffknew they were transgender were mistreated.
Forty seven percent of respondents to the survey also reported being sexually assaulted at some point in their lives. Trans people who have been homeless, those with disabilities, and those who have participated in sex work reported sexual assaults in even higher numbers.
PART TWO
What We Know: Who are the Victims?
Trans people of all genders are at risk of violence, but the combination of rampant transphobia, sexism and racism puts trans women of color in the most danger.
According to the 2017 A Time to Act report by the Human Rights Campaign and Trans People of Color Coalition, trans women are four times as likely to be the victims of homicide compared to the general population of women in the United States. Between 2013 and 2017, HRC and TPOCC have recorded 102 acts of fatal violence against transgender people. At least 88 of the victims were trans women and at least 87 of the victims were people of color.
According to the National Association of Anti- Violence Programs, violence against trans women of color is getting worse. The number of homicides of trans women of color has grown steadily over the past five years, from 12 hate violence homicides in 2013 to 22 in 2017 (though some reports are as high as 28).
Who are the perpetrators?
There are too many perpetrators of violence against trans people to name, too much data acknowledging the presence of attackers in the workplace, in public places, at home, in jails, in immigration detention centers. Trans people are attacked by police, by loved ones, and by strangers. Perpetrators of this violence are everywhere.
Tools of violence
The A Time to Act report found that of the 102 transgender homicides between 2013 and 2017, 61 of the victims died from gunshot wounds.
The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey found that, while 3% of overall respondents had been attacked with a gun in the past year, trans women of color were four times more likely to be attacked with a gun than other trans people. Those working in the underground economy were more than three times as likely to be the victims of gun violence and those with their only source of income being from the underground economy were more than five times as likely to have been attacked with a gun.
What We Don't Know
According to Naomi Goldberg, the Policy & Research Director at the Movement Advancement Project, there is no national government-sponsored survey that includes a question relating to trans people and their experiences.
While the FBI began collecting hate crime statistics in 2013, Angelica D'Souza, the LGBTQ & Hate Crime Victim Specialist with the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, said it is based only on data from states who are willing to report it. Beyond that, bad experiences with police and other law enforcement means many trans people likely do not report crimes committed against them at all. Fifty seven percent of respondents to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey said they would not be comfortable seeking help from the police.
"So much of the big systems-level response is based around reporting to law enforcement or reporting to victims services," said Gilmore. "So first of all, do you even feel like you can report it? Do you, as a transgender person, a transgender woman, recognize that these systems and laws also should be things that you have access to, that you have a right to support from, and a right for those places to be accountable to providing you with safety?
"Do you even think that based on your past experiences with other service providers or law enforcements or courts? Medical providers? What are all these reasons why you might not or why you might? And then how do those people respond to you? Do they mark it and indicate what kind of violence it is? Do they let you tell them what the violence is? Do they let you tell them how you identify? Does someone automatically put you in the category of male because they assume that you were assigned male at birth? If you say, I'm a woman, do they mark you as a woman or do they make a note that you're a transgender woman? Who knows? So yes, how do we get the data?"
Gilmore said the only way data is currently being collected is by organizations doing victims services who have created their own way to collect it and make it available. "So we're not getting a uniform way of collecting that data. It's hard to try to extrapolate, to say okay if we got 300 reports of violence against transgender women this past year what does that mean in terms of percentage? Well, we don't know. We don't know what to compare it to."
Additionally, standard domestic violence studies and surveys may not include a place for victims to identify themselves as anything other than male or female, which makes it very difficult to know whether trans women are included in stats about women on the whole. For example, the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey put out by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control breaks down all of their data by whether violence is happening to a man or a woman. The word transgender does not appear in their 2015 report.
PART THREE
The Services Trans People Don't Have
"You can't talk about violence against trans women and not talk about having decreased access to mental health services and decreased access to substance abuse services and decreased access to medical services and assault on immigrants," said Angelica D'Souza of the Cook County State's Attorney's Office. "It's all interwoven, and if you're somebody who is amongst the most that society marginalizes, you're even further excluded from services."
There is a massive need for more LGBTQ-affirming services, for more shelters, legal, and health services to provide gender-affirming support. "It's unacceptable that the places that in our society we have said are the places that are supposed to help survivors of violence often are places where LGBTQ people experience victimization again in forms of either discrimination or verbal violence or physical violence and sexual violence," said Gilmore.
She added some of the most important work she does is with organizations around policies for how their staffand volunteers work with LGBTQ people-essentially teaching them how to serve anyone who is not a cisgender woman. Most systems currently in place have been designed to exclusively keep cisgender women safe and do not have policies in place to help anyone else.
Even services that may be available to victims beyond cisgender women may not give the appearance that they are welcoming, said D'Souza. The Chicago Battered Women's Network, for example, alienates those who do not identify as women just by its name. And on the website of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, it calls itself "the vital link to safety for women, men, children, and families affected by domestic violence." Where does that leave trans and gender nonconforming people?
"There's a huge lack of competent care in the behavioral health and mental health fields," said D'Souza, "Even from folks that are LGBT affirming. Someone's whole life is not just that they're trans. People are whole people, so there's definitely a need for more competent and more affirming services, but there are definitely efforts underway that need support, that need money. Shit costs money, and without it it's hard to have a reach, but the folks who are doing the work are doing a lot of work with little money."
Regarding the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs 2016 Intimate Partner Violence Report, Emily Waters, NCAVP's Senior Manager of National Research and Policy, emphasized the need for community support and resources. "Rather than primarily focusing on prosecution of intimate partner violence as a "violent crime," as it is currently being framed by [U.S. Attorney General] JeffSessions, the Department of Justice should support and devote resources to LGBTQ organizations and groups that are working to address IPV from within the community," she said.
Gilmore agrees. "There's very little prevention resources for anti-LGBTQ violence that I know of," she said. "Most of the resources for victimization have to do with responding after victimization has already occurred. Most of the resources are built around these systems that broader society has set up that are about punishing and criminalizing and giving victims band aids and support and just get away from that person who is violent towards you."
The Services Trans People Do Have-in Chicago
Brave Space Alliance is the first Black-led, trans-led LGBTQ community center on the South Side of Chicago. According to LaSaia Wade, many trans victims of violence come to BSA for help. While BSA is not equipped to assist directly, they maintain a network of partnerships to domestic violence shelters, homeless shelters, and housing initiatives, all of which have undergone BSA's training in how to provide affirming services for trans people.
"We actually listen to what people need," Wade said, "and have that discussion with homeless shelters and push them to be politically aware of what's happening in the world."
BSA helps trans people with leadership development, access to jobs, and community, with the goal of creating a brave space where trans and queer people feel empowered to use their voices and speak out. For those on the West Side, Wade suggests Project Vida, and on the North Side, Howard Brown Health and its Broadway Youth Center.
Also on the West Side, Reyna Ortiz and her team do outreach work and programs through the TaskForce Prevention and Community Services. The Center on Halsted also has transgender services, as does Chicago House, through their TransLife and TransSafe programs.
Stopping the Violence
"Reducing violence is simpler than we think," said Wade. "Education." Educating people can happen in all sorts of ways. She emphasizes the need to educate people both beyond the LGBTQ community and within it-because discrimination happens within the community as well. The most productive conversations Wade has, she said, are with young people, who have not yet been "tainted" with prejudice. "If we start with our youth before any and everything," she said, "We don't have to worry about anything."
While we do need laws to change and we do need better policies, keeping trans people safe means doing more than that. It means fundamentally reshaping the way our culture views the transgender community. It means giving trans people access to jobs, healthcare and housing. It means honoring their pronouns and giving them representation in media as three-dimensional people who are more than their gender identities. It means raising children with a greater awareness of gender fluidity and teaching them not to hate what is different. Erasing a stigma that is so deeply embedded in society cannot happen overnight, but it must happen.
Wade acknowledges there has been some progress. "We're being seen in spaces we've never been seen," she said. "I am an ED. I have the chance to go into these spaces and push political knowledge. Most LGBT ED's are white or make $100,000 and above. So what does it look like when we have the same power? We might not have the same money, but what does it look like when we have the same power, saying yes or no in these physical spaces we normally do not have access to?"
Wade encourages more open and honest conversations in all communities about what people need to be their best and fullest selves. This, she believes, will begin to open the door for acceptance. "If the darkest, blackest trans woman is free," she says, "Everyone is free."

Originally from Wisconsin, Garden is remembered by loved ones as a "firecracker" who "didn't hold anything back." Friend and local transgender activist Mulan Montrese Williams recalls that Garden was a talented and aspiring hair stylist and had been saving money to fund her transition.
Diamond Stephens, 39, was found shot to death on June 18 in Meridian, Mississippi. In interviews with a local television station, family members said that Stephens had an "incredible personality." As is too often the case in the reporting of anti-transgender violence, Stephens was originally misgendered in local police statements and media reports, which delayed our awareness of this deadly incident.

Abstract: The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) has released the report "Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and HIV-Affected Intimate Partner Violence in 2016." (Chicago's Center on Halsted was the Illinois representative.) Among the results are: -LGBTQ and HIV-affected people of color made up 60 percent of the reports of IPV homicides, and 59 percent of the total number of survivors who reported to NCAVP members in 2016; -Transgender women were 2.5 times more likely to be stalked, 2.5 times more likely to experience financial violence, and twice as likely to experience online harassment within IPV; and -There was an increase in the percentage of survivors who identified as Latinx from 24 percent in 2015 to 30 percent in 2016. [...]the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation and the Trans People of Color Coalition (TPOCC) have released "A Time to Act: Fatal Violence Against Transgender People in America in 2017." Since the start of the year, at least 25 transgender people have been killed in the United States-the most on record.

Full text: The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) has released the report "Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and HIV-Affected Intimate Partner Violence in 2016."
The report looks at the experiences of 2,032 survivors of intimate-partner violence (IPV) who reported to 14 NCAVP member organizations from nine states, including California, Texas, New York, Arizona, Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, Vermont and Missouri. (Chicago's Center on Halsted was the Illinois representative.)
Among the results are:
-LGBTQ and HIV-affected people of color made up 60 percent of the reports of IPV homicides, and 59 percent of the total number of survivors who reported to NCAVP members in 2016;
-Transgender women were 2.5 times more likely to be stalked, 2.5 times more likely to experience financial violence, and twice as likely to experience online harassment within IPV; and
-There was an increase in the percentage of survivors who identified as Latinx from 24 percent in 2015 to 30 percent in 2016.
Also, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation and the Trans People of Color Coalition (TPOCC) have released "A Time to Act: Fatal Violence Against Transgender People in America in 2017."
Since the start of the year, at least 25 transgender people have been killed in the United States-the most on record. Eighty-four percent were people of color, and 80 percent were women.
This report lists those transgender individuals who have been killed so far in 2017, complete with photos and bios. There is then information about cases of fatal violence by race, gender identity and state, among other classifications. (Illinois, for example, has three cases of fatal violence between 2013-17; California and Louisiana were tied for the most, with 10 each.)
In a statement, Center on Halsted Chief Program Officer Dr. Hector Torres said, "As a founding member of NCAVP, Center on Halsted has been providing services to support LGBTQ survivors of domestic and sexual violence since 1988, while contributing to shifting policy and practice efforts to be more LGBTQ-inclusive, nationally."
"Not only are these individuals more likely to be targeted; their options for accessing safe and relevant services diminishes. This is a big reason why LGBTQ specific services are crucial to our communities," added Rachel Tillman, AVP cinical advocate at Center on Halsted.
In Chicago, the majority (57 percent) domestic and sexual violence reported to Center on Halsted's Anti-Violence Program , were made by those who identified as cisgender males. People of color accounted for 63 percent of known ethnicity (29 percent African American, 26 percent Latinx, 3 percent Arab/Middle Eastern, and 5 percent Asian). Of those who reported their sexuality, the majority identified as gay (49 percent) with lesbians (18 percent) making up the next largest category. Transgender survivors face particular vulnerabilities, for instance, reporting additional violence when reporting the abuse to police.

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/ncavp-report-2016-deadliest-year-hiv-lgbt/docview/1915308617/se-2?accountid=14696

Abstract: On Jun 12, the National Coalition of Anti Violence Programs (NCAVP) published its 2016 report. According to data collected nationwide throughout the coalition's 12 member programs, 2016 was the deadliest year on record for the LGBTQ Community. The report noted a 17% increase in homicides of LGBTQ people, not including the lives taken during the Pulse nightclub shooting. The NCAVP reported a total of 77 hate violence- related homicides of LGBTQ and HIV-affected people in 2016.

Full text: While the festivals, parades and appearance of Rainbow flags in cities across the world are traditions designed to celebrate Pride month, since 1997 the National Coalition of Anti Violence Programs (NCAVP) release of its National Report on Hate Violence Against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and HIV-Affected Communities has served as a sober reminder of the need to lift-up and humanize LGBTQ individuals yearround.
On June 12, the NCAVP published its 2016 report.
According to data collected nationwide throughout the coalition's 12 member programs, 2016 was "the deadliest year on record for the LGBTQ Community."
The report noted a "17 [percent] increase in homicides of LGBTQ people, not including the lives taken during the Pulse nightclub shooting."
June 12 also marked the one year anniversary of the massacre and ceremonies were held across the nation to remember the 49 souls who were ripped from their families and friends in a vicious act of hatred.
The NCAVP reported a total of 77 "hate violence-related homicides of LGBTQ and HIV-affected people in 2016."
It noted that 79 percent of those individuals were people of color, 68 percent were transgender and gender nonconforming people, 61 percent marked both the numbers of transgender women of color who were murdered that year and people under the age of 35.
The NCAVP also stated that it "received information on 1,036 incidents of hate violence across the country. The majority of survivors identified as gay, were below the age of 39, or were people of color."
The types of hate violence experienced included verbal harassment, threats or intimidation (all of which ranked as the most prevalent), physical violence, online or mobile harassment, discrimination and bullying.
Most of those people who reported an act of violence against them (58 percent) knew their attacker. The NCAVP went on to note that, of those people who reported an act of violence against them to law enforcement, "of those who interacted with police, 35 [percent] of survivors said that the police were indifferent and 31 [percent] said that the police were hostile."
In Illinois, the Center on Halsted stated that, in 2016, the organization "interfaced with 58 persons calling to report incidences of violence."
The Center added that the majority of those calls (78 percent) were intimate partner/domestic violence related while 22 percent were hate violence reports.
Lisa Gilmore is the principal and founder of the Illinois Accountability Initiative which is also a member program of the NCAVP. She also sits on the NCAVP's governance and policy committees.
"We have seen a cultural backlash against the gains made by the LGBTQ community in terms of civil rights," Gilmore told Windy City Times. "That backlash has occurred in policy in legislation across the United States. Bathroom bills and religious freedom acts are intentionally meant to push back against equality."
She added that, in the same way legislators have been using policy as a form of attack, "there are other people who use hate violence to show their opposition to LGBTQ equality and liberation. We have historically seen an increase in anti-LGBTQ violence during national campaigns for LGBTQ rights and obviously, during this past election cycle, we saw a lot of explicit rejection of people who are different."
In 2016, Windy City Times completed an extensive report into the correlation between an increase in anti-transgender propaganda and the violence against transgender and gender nonconforming individuals. Gilmore agrees that there is a link between hate crimes and anti-LGBTQ discourse in politics and the media.
The NCAVP's report from that year stated that "following the election, there was an increase in hate violence targeting LGBTQ people, Muslim communities, immigrant communities and communities of color. These communities were fearful that the Trump Administration and conservative legislators across the country would actively work to roll back the few protections they had, and that the hateful rhetoric used to support conservative policies would incite further acts of hate violence. Sadly, the actions taken by the federal administration, from discriminatory Executive Orders to the appointment of Jeff Sessions, Betsy Devos, and others, show that these fears were not unfounded."
"When you look at what is behind people who commit hate crimes, what you see is that the people who are perpetrating these crimes believe that they are trying to send a message about upholding social norms," Gilmore said. "When there are messages of otherness, rejection or people singled out as the root cause of the problems of others, it becomes much easier to perpetrate violence against these folks."
In terms of solutions and to mark the tenth anniversary of its work tracking hate violence nationwide, the NCVAP has released a platform designed to "end violence against LGBTQ communities."
The platform's calls to action include a recognition of "historical systems of oppression such as white supremacy and anti-Black racism, patriarchy and colonialism as root causes of violence."
It stresses the need to "support communitybased efforts that create pathways for individual and community healing" along with advocacy for "education, healthcare, housing and economic opportunities that affirm the experiences of transgender and gender nonconforming people of color."
Echoing an exponentially growing nationwide resistance movement, the NCAVP reasserted the need to "call out and resist 'religious exemption' and 'public accommodation' bills for the hateful legislation that they are" and to "act in solidarity with all movements working towards liberation and self-determination of people impacted by oppression and violence."
Gilmore added a need for messaging that celebrates the humanity of LGBTQ individuals.
"It's a lot harder for people to see someone as an object that they can do violence to when they see them as a fully human, worthy of respect who adds to the beauty of communities," she said. "Being the recipients of hate through culture does not define who we are."

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/patrick-dati-raises-voice-against-domestic-abuse/docview/1906866770/se-2?accountid=14696

Abstract: Dati said the assault also led to more abusive situations, including the one with his first male partner. In 2014, he wrote his memoir, I Am Me, detailing the abuse he endured and its impacts and he began doing public speaking engagements to talk about his experiences. Dati, who lives in Chicago, regularly speaks to youth at the Center on Halstead and has previously led discussions with the Chicago Police Department on intimate partner violence and how it uniquely impacts men and LGBT victims. Denise Brown, eldest sister of the late Nicole Brown Simpson, formed The Elite Speakers Bureau in 2010 to bring awareness and provide education on domestic violence, school safety, child abuse, teen violence, elder abuse, stalking, net crimes, workplace violence, victims of crime, sexual assault, mental health & wellness and more.

Full text: After coming out, Patrick Dati fell for a man who seemed great at first, but later began physically abusing him.
The abuse went on for a long time, reaching its peak one night when Dati said his partner threw him down a flight of stairs, sending him to the hospital with a broken arm.
Dati said by this point everyone was already aware of the abuse. His friends had encouraged him to get out of the relationship and many had abandoned him because they couldn't stand to watch him stay with his abuser.
That night was his turning point, but Dati said it wasn't easy and for most men and LGBT victims of intimate partner violence, getting out can be especially challenging and dangerous.
"When I speak at the Center on Halsted now and I speak to the youth, most are young, they meet older men or women who are successful and they move in with them. They've been deserted from their families and if they leave they have nowhere to go.
"That is the problem in regard to the LGBT community with domestic violence. It typically is the younger youth who draw to someone that they think can help them and they fall in love with them and that person is supportive financially and then that person becomes abusive and then they don't know how to get out and escape. It sounds really easy, they can walk out the door, but where will you go if you don't have the financial ability?"
Dati said in his situation he was able to move in with his parents for a while to escape his abuser and later sought help at Center on Halstead.
"I was living with him at that point and I needed to leave that situation," he said. "I waited until he leftand we removed all my items from his house and I moved back to my parents' house and he began stalking me. He came to my parent's house. I had a restraining order against him and my friends all knew it. He haunted me for several months. It was very difficult."
The situation wasn't Dati's first experience with violence. As a nine year old, he became the victim of serial killer and rapist John Wayne Gacy, who he said raped him in a public restroom.
That traumatic event had sent his life into a tailspin.
"After I was raped, I changed as an individual," he said.
He said he fell into a deep depression, flunked the third grade and began distancing himself from others.
"I kind of became this sheltered kid," he said. Dati said the assault also led to more abusive situations, including the one with his first male partner.
"People who have been abused are drawn to abusive people, but in my situation I was drawn to people that were good to me in the beginning and then it turned abusive," he said. "I felt I needed to help them and that I could help them, to stop them from abusing others."
Today, Dati is determined to use his experiences to help others. He said male victims are often forgotten about and he hopes to change that.
In 2014, he wrote his memoir, I Am Me, detailing the abuse he endured and its impacts and he began doing public speaking engagements to talk about his experiences.
Dati, who lives in Chicago, regularly speaks to youth at the Center on Halstead and has previously led discussions with the Chicago Police Department on intimate partner violence and how it uniquely impacts men and LGBT victims.
"It's public knowledge 80 to 85 percent of men don't come forward about their abuse out of fear and shame," Dati said. "It's no different in the LGBT community."
Recently, Dati was asked to join the Elite Speakers Bureau as its first gay male survivor of domestic abuse. He will speak to audiences nationwide about intimate partner violence affecting gay and straight men and the LGBTQ community.
Denise Brown, eldest sister of the late Nicole Brown Simpson, formed The Elite Speakers Bureau in 2010 to bring awareness and provide education on domestic violence, school safety, child abuse, teen violence, elder abuse, stalking, net crimes, workplace violence, victims of crime, sexual assault, mental health & wellness and more.
"I am so grateful to Denise Brown for giving me this platform to amplify the often invisible issue of domestic abuse impacting gay men, straight men and members of the LGBTQ community," Dati said.
Dati was also elected earlier this year to the board of directors for the Break the Silence Foundation, a domestic violence non-profit. He is serving as chairman of the planning committee.
Dati is also working on a second book, which he said is focused on the impacts of intimate partner violence and domestic violence on mental health.
"A lot of times folks think that goes away with therapy or medication," he said. "People believe you are cured and you are not. I learned that firsthand when my first book came out and I was on a book tour, doing radio, TV, etcetera. I thought 'I'm making a difference and doing something great for the world,' but then it slipped away and part of the reason is I stopped seeing my psychiatrist and taking my meds, and that happens to a lot of individuals."
Dati said his message to others is pretty simple, "You need to get out of that situation because it isn't going to change."
He added, "For me, it was a cycle of abuse. I didn't want to live that way anymore and I wanted to be a happy person and I wanted to be secure. There is hope and you don't need to live with abuse. Sometimes it is difficult to walk away, but at the same time by walking away you get back your sense of security."
He also encourages individuals experiencing abuse or who have leftabusive situations to get professional help in dealing with the trauma.
"Most importantly is psychological therapy," he said. "Without that it's not going to change."
Dati and Brown will speak at Break the Silence Foundation's annual gala on Friday, Oct. 27, at the Donald E. Stephens Convention Center, 5555 Rosemont Rd., in Rosemont, Illinois.

Full text:   Headnote BOOKS
In new book, Chicago author dispels myths and finds intimate partner violence is more prevalent than believed
Many LGBTQ people experience some form of violence from their partners at some point, but this often goes unreported and even unnoticed.
In fact, more than 43 percent of lesbian women and 26 percent of gay men in the U.S. have experienced some type of physical intimate partner violence, or IPV, according to sources cited in Dr. Adam Messinger's new book, LGBTQ Intimate Partner Violence: Lessons for Policy, Practice, and Research, published by the University of California Press.
The prevalence rate for physical IPV among bisexual women and men is upwards of 60 percent and 37 percent, respectively, while trans* people reported up to 46 percent, writes Messinger, a professor at Northeastern Illinois University.
In all instances, physical IPV rates were higher for LGBTQ people than for heterosexual cisgender couples, according to the book. The same is true for other types of violence, including psychological violence.
Messinger reviewed more than 600 research publications from various disciplines spanning six continents and four decades of research, in what he says is a comprehensive approach to LGBTQ IPV research.
"Every article I'd read on LGBTQ IPV would begin with the statement, 'there's not a lot of research on this.' And after writing the book I can say, 'that's not entirely true.' There's quite a bit,'" Messinger told Windy City Times.
Rather, LGBTQ IPV research exists but it is segmented by sexual minority and academic discipline, dispersed among scores of hard-to-access databases, Messinger found.
"My hope is that the book raises the national public profile of LGBTQ IPV. It's a real, serious problem," he said.
Myths and barriers
Several myths surround LGBTQ IPV: that it is rare or less severe than violence in heterosexual relationships. There is an assumption that LGBTQ people are inherently nonviolent, especially sexual minority women, according to Messinger.
But this stereotype can prevent "lesbian female victims' ability to recognize that a partner's behavior is in fact abusive rather than normal," Messinger writes.
Similarly, in male same-gender relationships, men are stereotypically viewed to be of similar physical strength and able to "hold their own."
"Men often times report feeling particularly worried about seeking help because no one would believe them and they'll feel like somehow they're less of a man or someone else will say that," Messinger said.
But IPV is not only physical-it also includes psychological, emotional and even "identity" violence, Messinger said.
"For instance, a substantial amount of research has shown that people who are not yet out of the closet about their sexual orientation or their trans* identity to everyone in their lives-and frankly most people aren't out to everyone- leaves them vulnerable to abusers who might use that as leverage to say, 'if you tell anyone about what I'm doing to you or if you leave me, I can out you to your parents, your siblings, to your employer, your friends,'" Messinger said.
Conversely, abusers sometimes pressure victims to remain closeted, especially if the abuser is not out to everyone in their life.
Furthermore, many U.S. states lack anti-discrimination laws protecting LGBTQ people in housing, employment and public accommodation. And barriers for transgender people being able to change their names and gender listed on formal identification "has a ripple effect throughout their lives," Messinger said.
In some states, if one were to pursue a protective order or engage in a civil suit under domestic violence statues, "it's quite possible that that state might require your name and identity to become public."
"That really creates a lot of barriers to being able to ask for help and not have to out yourself at the same time," Messinger said.
"The law is not on the side of LGBTQ people who experience intimate partner violence," making it more difficult for victims to receive help.
Messinger pointed to other myths that make LGBTQ IPV unique: that it should not be discussed out of fear of undermining LBGTQ struggles for equality and that LGBTQ IPV abusers are masculine.
Messinger said he hopes his book draws attention to the issue of LGBTQ IPV "when there is so little in terms of resources and policy being oriented towards this issue." And with all the challenges and unique traits of LGBTQ IPV, customized resources and support are necessary, he said.
He wrote the book as a sort of how-to guide with practical tips and a broad audience in mind-law enforcement, mental and medical health providers, social workers, domestic violence hotline operators, domestic violence shelter staff, policymakers, victims, allies and advocates.
What's next
Messinger reviewed scores of literature published in English, but he said he'd like to see further research in other languages, at a time when same-gender marriage is fully legal in about 22 nations and 15 countries permit joint adoption by same-gender couples.
There is also a lack of research on how LGBTQ IPV intersects with the criminal justice system, he said.
Police are 10 to 30 times more likely to arrest both partners in cases of violence between samegender partners than different-gender partners, Messinger writes.
"It sends the wrong message to the victim that somehow if they seek help, they're the ones who are going to suffer for it," Messinger said.
"Often times that makes it harder for victims to receive services because they're labeled an abuser, making it difficult to get into a shelter," he said.
Messinger is also part of a research team conducting longitudinal research of IPV among youths to see how patterns of abuse change over time.
LGBTQ Intimate Partner Violence: Lessons for Policy, Practice, and Research is published by the University of California Press, and is available in hardcover and e-book through Amazon and Barnes and Noble.

Full text:   Headnote SPRING CONCERT PREVIEW
Many local and visiting LGBTQ performers and their allies raise their voices and share their musical skills this spring. Here are a few concerts to check out. All locations in Chicago unless otherwise noted.
Windy City Performing Arts is the umbrella organization for the ensembles of the Windy City Gay Chorus (Chicago's oldest gay choral group) and the Windy City Treble Quire. After tackling Orff's cantata Carmina Burana last year, the organization is now returning to the major classical choral work that is Fauré's Requiem. Also in the pipeline for June is a Pride concert titled Pulse. (Fauré's Requiem is at 5 and 8 p.m. on Saturday, March 18, at First United Methodist Chruch, 77 W. Washington St.; visit WindyCitySings.org.)
The Concert for America was devised as a fundraiser for organizations like the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the Sierra Club, the NAACP, the National Immigration Law Center and the Southern Poverty Law Center in the wake of recent political shifts in America. Sirius XM Broadway host Seth Rudetsky and his husband, Broadway producer James Wesley, were the founders of the Concert for America, and they feature a mix of Broadway, TV and film performers.
The Concert for America comes to Chicago for the first time with stars like two-time Tony Award-winner Chita Rivera, pop star Melissa Manchester, two-time Emmy Award-winner Sharon Gless, cast members from Hamilton in Chicago and more. (8 p.m. Monday, March 20, at the Auditorium Theatre of Roosevelt University, 50 E. Congress Parkway; AuditoriumTheatre.org)
Seth Rudetsky is also involved as the music director and accompanist for a joint concert featuring six-time Tony winner Audra McDonald and her husband, Tony nominee Will Swenson, at Steppenwolf Theatre, 1650 N. Halsted St. (6:30 p.m. Monday, May 22; Steppenwolf.org)
The Chicago Sinfonietta's upcoming concerts of More Than a Letter are billed as "A Celebration of LGBTQ Artists and Classical Music." Guest conductor Michael Morgan leads performances of works by composers Bernstein, Higdon, Barber and more. Guest artists include pianist Sara Davis Buechner and the choruses Allegrezza Singers and Musicality. (8 p.m. Saturday, March 25, at North Central College's Wenz Concert Hall, 171 E. Chicago Ave., Naperville; then at 7:30 p.m. Monday, March 27, at Symphony Center, 220 S. Michigan Ave.; chicagosinfonietta.org)
The Allegrezza Singers perform their own choral concerts titled Turn the World Around at 3 p.m. Sunday, May 7, at Union Church, 137 S. Garfield St., Hinsdale, and at 7:30 p.m. Friday, May 12 at Ebenezer Lutheran Church, 1650 W. Foster Ave. Visit AllegrezzaSingers.com.
In the touring concert *BTown, the Chicago Gay Men's Chorus explores all kinds of boy bands ranging from barbershop quartets to modern pop groups like *NSYNC and One Direction. The London Gay Men's Chorus is also slated to perform with the Chicago Gay Men's Chorus at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, May 25, at a venue to be determined.

Abstract: The Anti-Violence Project (AVP) at the Center on Halsted "empowers lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and HIV-affected communities and allies to end all forms of violence through organizing and education, and supports survivors through counseling and advocacy." the Center states. AVP is not primarily grant-funded; we rely on the Center and also get funding through the [federal] Violence Against Women Act [VAWA] and the [Illinois] attorney general's office. Domestic violence in men is often neglected, unnoticed, or treated as mutual fighting, yet one in three bisexual men have experienced intimate partner violence. 6.

Full text:   The Anti-Violence Project (AVP) at the Center on Halsted "empowers lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and HIV-affected communities and allies to end all forms of violence through organizing and education, and supports survivors through counseling and advocacy." the Center states.
Windy City Times spoke with Rachel L. Tillman, a licensed clinical professional counselor who runs the AVP, about her work.
Windy City Times: How did the Center's AntiViolence Project (AVP) come about?
Rachel Tillman: The Center was one of the founding members [in 1995] of the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs [NCAVP], a reporting entity and coalition of 57 members who get together to influence policy on local and national levels. At that time, there wasn't an entity that focused specifically on violence that targets LGBTQ communities.
There was, and still is, a sense that things are underreported. They also wanted to have a little bit more control in how things are reported- instead of grouping men and women together while not even considering sexual orientation. We connect people with resources, from housing to employment, and we offer individual, couples and group therapy. We currently have two groups for survivors of trauma, one of which is the domestic violence/intimate partner violence (DV/ IPV) group that I run. We also have a violence resource line.
WCT: How does the program receive funding?
RT: AVP is not primarily grant-funded; we rely on the Center and also get funding through the [federal] Violence Against Women Act [VAWA] and the [Illinois] attorney general's office.
WCT: How, politically, could that drastically change funding for your program [since VAWA is federal]?
RT: Yeah. That's, in part, why it's very important that we are a coalition, as opposed to oneoff entities. I was just on a call yesterday and we were talking about, "What do we do with the new attorney general and with [the threat to] Violence Against Women Act funding?" Our current funding is through the Illinois attorney general's office, not the federal level.
WCT: Are the volunteers that you work with, in general, Center on Halsted volunteers?
RT: I supervise, recruit and train volunteers, so it's a bit more of a vetting process. It's a three-month minimum commitment because there's a lot of training on how to handle calls. You're dealing with people, oftentimes who are confused, distressed and might not even know they're distressed. People who want to help can also donate, writing "Anti-Violence Project" in the memo line [of a check].
WCT: Are there any statistics that you can give me concerning LGBTQ DV/IPV that you think people would be surprised to hear?
RT: Sixty-eight percent of our callers identify as men. The Center has a reputation for being a gay male organization and that might be why men, in particular, know that we're safe to call. But it is a bit alarming that our stats are a bit reversed, gender-wise.
The problem with that stat is not just the general shock value, but the fact that there is only one DV shelter for men in the whole city and there are at least 22 for women. I can't even count how many males try to go through the court system to get an order of protection, and it's denied because it's perceived that when men are violent, it's mutual. It's an often-neglected area in the field of DV.
WCT: What has been the community reaction to the group?
RT: We have gotten a lot of calls from people who are looking for an LGBT-specific group. There are entities that are very LGBTQ-friendly, but they're not exclusive. We are the only group, to my knowledge, that says, if you identify as straight, we're going to refer you out, just because we want this to feel like a safe group for people who identify as LGBTQ. I want to be very clear, I mean L-G-B-T-Q, so if people identify as bisexual and are in an opposite-sex DV relationship, they are welcome, too. What is often the case is that there's a bi female partnered with a straight male and, oftentimes, her sexuality is used against her in a domestic-violence way.
WCT: What typically happens in a session?
RT: We have a loose curriculum I developed, in collaboration with other materials. We do a mindfulness exercise to get people a little bit more connected to their bodies and aware. Then we have a topical discussion. Oftentimes, we do individual reflection followed by group sharing. The group lasts about 90 minutes and we try to keep it small in size.
WCT: What does Center on Halsted do to ensure the safety and anonymity of group members?
RT: We're bound by HIPAA [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act] law. In order to ensure physical safety, all of the clients have to have a key card to get access to our therapy groups. We also limit people in the group to those who do not identify as offenders. We maintain safety as to not retraumatize.
WCT: What do you think is the main stigma attached to IPV in the LGBTQ community?
RT: Externally, the way people outside of the community-from law enforcement to service providers-minimize, neglect and retraumatize. The other prong is internal, the internal silence in the sense that the community is small. Who can I talk to about this when this person just led an awesome speech at, for example, Dyke March, and nobody is going to believe what she does at home? And then you want me to call the Center where I might know somebody on staff? Where do you go to for support within your own community? That's probably what we see very often.
WCT: How does intersectionality come into play when recommending resources, care and support?
RT: It's absolutely crucial and it's best practice. From ethnicity to immigration status-it all comes into play. It's scary because right now we're dealing with an influx of people who are more afraid to talk about domestic violence because they're undocumented and have deportation fears because of the current political climate. Intersectionality impacts everything we do.

Calls to action
Rachel Tillman, LCPC, followed up with WCT with these calls to action in terms of DV/IPV:
1. Volunteer: Center on Halsted's Anti-Violence Project; RVA (Rape Victims' Advocates); The Network: National.
2. Give: Center on Halsted; other AVPs in states with limited protections (AVP.org).
3. Learn: A crucial dynamic in DV is power and control, not bruises and black eyes.
4. Be: A safe person, not shocked or disbelieving anything when someone in the community starts talking about their relationships: If two in five lesbian women and two out of three bisexual women have experienced violence by an intimate partner, then you've met a survivor or are one.
5. Ask and Notice relationships: Domestic violence in men is often neglected, unnoticed, or treated as mutual fighting, yet one in three bisexual men have experienced intimate partner violence.
6. Kickstart: Seventy-one percent of DV survivors reported being denied emergency shelter due to gender identity. We need more shelters accepting of all gender identities, gender nonbinary, etc.
7. (Safely) Report: Transgender domestic violence is underreported and often the survivor is criminalized (or deported).
8. Call: The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) is up for re-authorization next year-let's ensure that provisions that protect sexual orientation and gender identity remain. Call the U.S. Department of Justice. If you live in a historically red state, contact your state's U.S. representative to voice your support for reauthorization.
9. Show up: The support at airports was amazing-let's also show up at courthouses and ensure that survivors are not arrested-a violation of VAWA.

Full text:   Ever since the early morning hours of Nov. 9, 2016-when it was clear that our country elected an incompetent, inexperienced, sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic and admitted sex offender to be the 45th president of the United States of America-I have been barely able to write anything more than social-media posts.
I have spent the time since that date doing more "acting" than writing. But I think I have my voice back.
For 33 years, I have covered the LGBTQ community, and the mainstream Chicago world. Sometimes my journalism work, and my work as a publisher, parallels a need to also act, whether that was doing the March on Springfield for Marriage Equality, the summit on youth homelessness, tiny homes or the Gay Games in 2006.
This time, it was being part of the leadership of the Women's March on Chicago.
The three co-chairs of the march-Ann Scholhamer, Liz Radford and Jessica Scheller-were extremely open to including myself and others as part of their leadership team. The three of them were new to this type of organizing, and they quickly built up a collaborative team around them to create a stellar march that brought together 250,000 women and their allies to downtown Chicago Jan. 21, part of more than 600 marches around the world that attracted millions of people.
The same openness was true of the Illinois delegation to the March on Washington-Mrinalini Chakraborty, Leni Manaa-Hoppenworth, Amanda Drenth, Amanda Jane Long, Julie List and Amber Hummel.
More than a 100 Chicago-area organizations- some nonprofit, some political-also helped. From experienced groups including Chicago Women Take Action, NOW, Planned Parenthood, Operation PUSH, Pride Action Tank and SEIU Healthcare to newer groups and many individuals, the marches attracted an incredible team.
I know that for some of the people I cover and work with, they wonder why many people have not marched in the streets for the injustices that occurred even under President Obama. There were immigrants in horrible detention centers, deportations, and much injustice the past eight years, most of it not under his control, but still happening, from police violence to under-resourced communities. Not everyone benefitted from the successes under Obama, and Obama himself was strangled by the GOP-we should have been in the streets against the GOP long ago.
But we are here now, so we need to respond. Perhaps this catastrophe's main benefit will be in bringing people together across the movements, from Black Lives Matter and Black Youth Project 100 to trans and LGBTQ rights, healthcare, homelessness, raising the minimum wage, immigrant justice, gun violence and many inter-connected issues.
Forward movement
So how do we move forward?
There are dozens if not hundreds of new national and local groups created to respond to the new American order. But we also can't forget that there are existing institutions with great resources that can also be marshaled.
There will be no one right way to dismantle this horror. Likely most of the 250,000 people at Chicago's march, and the thousands of Illinoisans who went to D.C., are already engaged in some form of activism. It may be just online, or with a religious or school group, but right now, everything matters. At the very least, they have a network of friends and family they can help activate.
In addition, the organizations that did the marches have assets-including their access to attendees who signed up for their social media accounts. In fact, we are working to piggyback the annual Peggy Notebaert Volunteer Expo Feb. 26 to make sure to push for volunteers to the groups that helped support the marches.
So using all of these networks will be key to fight the regime. But some of this work should be done regardless of who occupies the White House, because the needs are so great on the ground in all 50 states. The federal government is not the only solution to the problems facing Chicagoans-it is only part of what is needed. So now that it will likely abdicate its responsibilities and privatize much of what should be government's role in the safety net, it's going to be up to well-resourced people and groups to help those who do not have access to resources.
Here are a few ideas:
-Wealthy progressives, and anyone with disposable income, need to step up to the plate more than they ever have. They need to look beyond their social circles, and typical nonprofits they back, to a long list of social justice and social service groups. Get out of your comfort zone and give money to the Fight for $15, to Black Lives Matter, BYP100, the Immigrant Youth Justice League, Pride Action Tank, SEIU Healthcare, Planned Parenthood, Chicago Survivors, domestic violence and homeless groups, among many others. There will also be new groups, such as Rise Movement-explore, explore, explore, for the new and innovative, and the tried and true.
-Politics is both national and local. The Democratic Party has always felt like a factory system, where you "do your time" and you get rewarded with that next open seat. That process has not created a deep pool of candidates that can speak to the people, and crush the gerrymandering attempts of the GOP. To "rise up" the party must have a better way to allow for innovation, for charismatic, passionate candidates and leadership who don't play by the old rules, who can attract new voters and bring life back into the party.
-The relatively new tools of social media can be exploited in great ways to help social-justice and social-service groups. We have not done a good job of coalition building in the past because each group often is very proprietary of their connections to money and other assets. This has to stop. No one is asking for the massive institutions to give away their email lists. But wouldn't it be great for the institutions to work together to better cross promote events and needs to lesser-resourced groups?
Here are some examples. The Women's March on Chicago and the Illinois delegation to D.C. have large social media followings. In addition, many groups supported these efforts, and they each have followings on social media. A cross-promotion of fundraising could happen for the groups. Yes, there would be limitations based on some groups being non-partisan, but I am mainly talking about social justice groups and services, not candidates and political action committees.
So, here is how it could work. Each week, for 52 weeks a year, every partner group agrees to promote an online fundraising campaign for the selected social justice groups that week. The emphasis being on smaller groups (maybe one large and two small social justice groups each week). In addition, everyone would agree to post a list of actions happening among these groups, to all of their social media channels. This could be an anti-violence or immigration-rights protest, or a march in front of a religious institution that has been vandalized, or a push for a responsible budget in Illinois. Partners could "opt out" if the action violates their nonprofit status.
Why should larger and smaller groups do this, when it might cut into their own efforts? First, I believe firmly that when you help others you help yourself. That is true for individuals, businesses and nonprofits. When I see Planned Parenthood or Lambda Legal helping others, or working in coalition, I am much more likely to support them. Second, we are in a time now where we must lift all boats. All means all. If funds are being cut to all domestic violence services in Illinois, we need a statewide call to action and fundraising. Same for youth homeless services. And for acting up when there is a police shooting against an unarmed young African-American on Chicago's South Side.
This is what being a good ally is all about.
-Corporations that value their employees and customers must also figure out a way to be part of the solution. During the battle for LGBTQ rights, corporate allies have played an increasing role of support, and clout. They have helped fight against anti-LGBTQ legislation, some going so far as to boycott cities and states doing bad deeds. They must now look to expand this social justice mission to other areas where they can have influence-which is almost everywhere. Now that corporations are "people," they have a much louder voice in politics, and we as consumers can pressure them to use that voice for good (while at the same time fighting the notion that they are people!). Corporations, and their employee resources groups, also can move on social justice issues, raising funds, and providing free talent and resources, to numerous issues under attack.
-Some religious organizations have always been social justice-oriented. But many others do little to nothing to provide money, space or other resources to issues outside of their geographic zones. Even within their zones, many do not provide help to those most in need. All need to step it up, and that could mean with food, space for meetings, shelter, fundraising or political action.
I could go on and on with ideas, but I will leave more for another day.
Staying active in the resistance
I have been fighting for social justice since high school and college, but especially since 1984, when I started work in LGBTQ media. I have seen many activists and groups come and go, some quickly, some that last many years. I have been asked about my ability to stay connected without a break in 33 years. (I guess this is my Jesus year of official activism/journalism.)
First, it is not for everyone. Some people have a huge spark and give their all for one to three years, and then they have to check out for valid reasons.
Second, some of the absolute worst that I have experienced has come from people within the community, not outside of it. The outside forces are usually a nebulous entity without specific form. But those inside a community have the ability to really de-motivate and do damage to their peers, like crabs in a tank who don't work together to get out, but pull each other down. You can't let that get to you-move on to a different organization if some peer-to-peer work is damaging.
Third, do not think you can do it all. I work deeply on some issues, and then support others in more surface ways. I care about so many issues (LGBTQ and otherwise), but I know I can't help them all. But I can do small things for every issue, even if it's a tweet, or going to an event or protest.
Fourth, and I can't emphasize this one enough, I love what I do, and I have a lot of fun doing it. I have met incredible people through all of these projects, including recently with these two march groups. You have to enjoy it, and have some fun, to sustain. This work can nourish you and make you feel connected and vital. If you don't love it, leave it.
Finally, assess what you really have to give, both in time and money, and divide it the best way you can. Even $5 a week to a small group means a lot, or one hour a month can help another.
Right now, everyone needs to dig deep. Deep can be $1 or $1 million. Deep can be one hour a month or 10 hours a week. It can be anything you are able to do-just do something.

Full text:   [Note: The names are fictional and the couple described is a composite of numerous couples I counseled on interpersonal violence (IPV).]
The Jills were the envy among us lesbian couples of African descent. Their public display of love for each other and their exchanges of their special terms of endearment was the stuff you read in romance novels. They were inseparable, and we distinguished them by calling them Jill and Jillie.
When I received the call that one was being seen in the ER and other one was being detained by the police for battering, I knew it had to be a mistake. But looking back there were visible signs of interpersonal violence (IPV) that we sistah-friends came to understand and wished we could have intervened on their behalf. But we were so enamored, envious and awestruck by their oversized demonstrative displays of love and seeming respect for each other, we didn't see their troubled marriage.
October is Domestic Awareness Month, and within LGBTQ communities of color, not enough attention, education, intervention and advocacy are given to this issue.
The 2014 Advocate article "2 Studies That Prove Domestic Violence is an LGBT issue" reports that "21.5 percent of men and 35.4 percent of women living with a same-sex partner experienced intimate-partner physical violence in their lifetimes. ... Transgender respondents had an incidence of 34.6 percent over a lifetime according to a Massachusetts survey." An interpersonal Violence (IPV) study conducted in 2011 stated that LGBTQ communities of color are one of the demographic groups experiencing high incidents of domestic violence.
However, obtaining accurate statistics of how high IPV is in these communities is obfuscated by social stigmas and cultural taboos, and there are also racism as well as other forms of oppressions and discriminations.
What also interferes in obtaining accurate statistics on how high IPV is in these communities of color is that same-gender interpersonal violence is clouded with myths. And within these communities there are several cultural barriers preventing reporting domestic violence and receiving interventive services.
The Black Church is one of them.
Jill grew up in the church and whenever troubled and heavy burdened she took her woes and concerns there. The network of support through prayer and counselling wasn't available to Jill and her spouse once she came out.
Even in 2016, many Black churches are woefully far behind the country's acceptance of LGBTQ Americans. These places of worship are still spewing homophobic rhetoric from their bully pulpits. And, unfortunately, some LGBTQ victims of IPV have internalized the church's message that they are abominations to God and, therefore, deserved to be abused, flogged and beaten.
"I thought I showed strength by staying in the relationship. I thought if we acted happy we would become happy," Jill stated.
With too many churches espousing a theology emphasizing the place and value of suffering in one's life as a test from God like that of the biblical Job coupled with the marriage vow "for richer or poorer until death do us part" the act forgiveness is seductively elevated as both redemptive and virtuous that too many LGBTQ victims remain in abusive relationships.
The politic of silence is another cultural barrier preventing reporting domestic violence and receiving interventive services.
While silence diminishes a deleterious white gaze on the Black community-past and present-we need to address problems plaguing our communities, like HIV/AIDS, mental illness, suicide and IPV, to name a few. Rather than addressing these problems, they are spun into a damaging discourse of blame, shame, stigma and misinformation. And with many of us having to confront the daily microaggressions of racism and homophobia in the workplace and out in the world, the last thing many LGBTQ victims want to tackle is IPV at home, often considered a "safe space."
Jill's spouse suffered from bipolar disorder and always attributed her spouse's violence to her mood changes. Looking back, we sisterfriends only saw the couple during what they depicted as being "jubilantly high on love."
The dominant view by both healthcare professions and law-enforcement officers is that communities of color, especially of African descent, have a predisposition toward violence that gravely interferes with victims taking action and a community raising awareness.
With a cultural distrust of law-enforcement officers due to the rash of shootings and killings of unarmed Black men and women in streets, most in my community-straight or LGBTQ-call for them only in extreme dire situations, with prayers and hopes of no fatalities. Consequently, victims of IPV, especially LGBTQs, are not taken seriously.
For example, the myth that since both the victim and the abuser are of the same gender and are also in a consensual sexual relationship may lead many officers to confuse same-gender sexual violence as part and parcel of being homosexual.
Healthcare disparities in communities of color and LGBTQs are only exacerbated for LGBTQ people of color. Sadly, this creates distrust as well as a lack and underutilization of resources toward healing, moving on and prevention.
The Jills have finally separated-but not because of police intervention or heathcare prevention. We sister-friends stepped in. Not everyone has a support system.
Resources and services have to be made available to LGBTQ communities of color. And this is the time to reach out to us. Everyone deserves a safe, loving, healthy and violentfree relationship.

Abstract: Even though this weekend's violent shooting was perhaps the most devastating, it was not an isolated event-violence towards the LGBTQ community is rampant. LGBTQ people are twice as likely to be victims of hate crimes, compared to other marginalized communities. For LGBTQ Latinos who experience racism, homophobia, and transphobia, the violence is far too common.

Full text:   CHICAGO (June 18)-This past weekend, the LGBTQ community was attacked in Orlando, Florida in what is considered to be the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The shooting occurred at Pulse, a nightclub for the LGBTQ community, during its weekly "Latin" night. Forty-nine individuals died, and an additional 53 were injured. The majority of those victims are LGBTQ Latinos - they were our children, our brothers and sisters, our family. We send our condolences to the families and loved ones of those whose life was cut short during this senseless act.
Even though this weekend's violent shooting was perhaps the most devastating, it was not an isolated event-violence towards the LGBTQ community is rampant. LGBTQ people are twice as likely to be victims of hate crimes, compared to other marginalized communities. For LGBTQ Latinos who experience racism, homophobia, and transphobia, the violence is far too common. A national report conducted by the Human Rights Campaign and League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) found that LGBTQ Latino youth are three times more likely to face harassment and violence than are their non-LGBTQ Latino peers-in their communities, in our communities. The violence directed at members of our community is something we can no longer ignore.
In light of the shooting in Orlando, we must come together, not only to help the LGBTQ Latino community heal, but also to act. Now more than ever, we must commit ourselves to eradicating homophobia and transphobia in our Latino communities. While there has been much progress for the LGBTQ community, such as marriage equality, we must continue to work to ensure that all LGBTQ people are able to live without fear of losing their lives due to intolerance and hate. We need to challenge the antiLGBTQ sentiments from within our own families and communities. We must remember that LGBTQ Latinos are part of our entire community, and that their love is just as important.
It is also imperative that our laws reflect our values to ensure we build safe communities for everyone. We must hold our elected officials and leaders accountable, rejecting hateful rhetoric that seeks to divide and cause harm. We must pressure them to work on policy that will ensure complete equality and fair treatment for the LGBTQ community as well as legislation that will put an end to this senseless gun violence. We must also be willing to stand in solidarity with other marginalized communities, we cannot allow this tragedy to perpetuate Islamophobia. Now more than ever we need to work and move forward in unison.
The Latino communities in Chicago, and our allies, stand with the Latino and LGBTQ communities in Orlando. We send our sympathy to the LGBTQ Latino community across the country that continues to mourn and begins to heal. We will stand with the LGBTQ community to end homophobia and transphobia once and for all.

Demystifying sexual abuse in the LGBTQ community

Abstract: Sexual abuse is a difficult topic for anyone to talk about. It evokes a lot of fear, confusion, anger, and shame-a potent mix that helps keep the topic out of our daily conversations. But sadly, abuse is part of our everyday world," Research Psychologist Dr. Nina Burrowes said. "It's a statistical inevitability that all of us have people in our lives who have experienced abuse-especially within the LGBT community.

Full text:   Even with social-media posts flying every which way through the glass ceiling and into the depths of cyberspace, sexual abuse among lesbians is still not in the forefront of what readers seem to consume on a daily basis. Rather, it's which celebrity dyed their hair this week and headlines like, "Did Lindsay Lohan really Photoshop her own backside for Instagram?" that retain the most water.
"Sexual abuse is a difficult topic for anyone to talk about. It evokes a lot of fear, confusion, anger, and shame-a potent mix that helps keep the topic out of our daily conversations. But sadly, abuse is part of our everyday world," Research Psychologist Dr. Nina Burrowes said. "It's a statistical inevitability that all of us have people in our lives who have experienced abuse-especially within the LGBT community. Research data tells us that members of our community are more likely to report that they have experienced abuse. So it's essential that the LGBT community talks about it more."
The inevitable question is: "Why?"
"There are a few different theories. Most people are abused by men. For some people this can lead to a massive mistrust of men that prevents them from feeling safe enough to enter into a relationship with any man, and so they only form relationships with women," Burrowes explained. "I'm sure this is true for some women in the LGBT community, but I don't think it fully explains the data, especially as it doesn't help to explain why men in the LGBT community also tend to report higher levels of abuse."
Another theory involves the coming-out process.
"An alternative theory is about the process of coming out as a lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. Many people who have experienced abuse repress, deny or minimize the experience to themselves. And so when they are filling in a survey they may not report the abuse as abuse-either because they are afraid of what people will think of them or because they are still not admitting the truth to themselves," Burrowes said. "It's possible that people who are comfortable stating that they are LGBT in surveys are also more likely to recognize that they have been abused and feel comfortable enough to disclose this on the survey."
Becoming a potential target is another rationale.
"Of course the most uncomfortable reason for the increased reporting of abuse within the LGBT community is that we could be the target of abuse-either because people are living in higher risk situations because they have been excluded from their own communities, because some abusers may specifically target the LGBT community, and because there are also abusers within our community," Burrowes said.
The abused are often silent witnesses to a crime that no one even knows exists.
"We have ideas in our head about abusers and abuse. We talk about men targeting children in playgrounds and strangers in alleyways. When you have an experience of abuse that is at the hands of someone you trusted, it can be very confusing," Burrowes said. "It can feel easier to blame yourself or dismiss what happened. We know that many people don't report the crimes to the police, but I believe that many people never tell anyone about what happened."
Often those who do tell another person or the authorities about the abuse are reprimanded themselves.
"A common reaction to someone who is in an abusive relationship is, 'Why don't you just leave?' This feels like the common sense thing to do, but often the situation is a lot more complex than that. An abuser can dominate every aspect of your life-the abuse can be physical, sexual, emotional, financial. Leaving can be a long process that requires a lot of support," Burrowes explained.
With the increase of acceptance regarding LGBT relationships with marriage laws, adoption rights and such, have statistics shown any decrease in domestic violence?
"Sadly, no. I don't see any connection between the legal status of your relationship and domestic violence," Burrowes said. "Heterosexual couples have had these legal rights for years and they have been abusing each other for just as long. However, the changes may mean that there is more legal power and financial rights for anyone who is looking to leave an abusive relationship."
No one is immune in helping to stop the cycle of abuse, according to Burrowes. "I think it's important that we engage all generations on this issue-from our elders down to our toddlers. It's important that young people are aware of the laws around consent and abuse. But it's more important that we help them learn about relationships, sex, love, respect, and body choice. Relationships and sex can be beautiful, but they are also extremely challenging. You can feel vulnerable, worried about your body, worried about pleasing your partner, scared about rejection, scared about commitment. We're psychologically as well as physically naked during sex and intimacy. We need to help young people live with these vulnerabilities and challenges rather than only focusing on the laws and avoiding sexually transmitted diseases."
Burrowes created a cartoon-based book to facilitate more discussion around the topic closest to her heart. The Courage to be Me joins a group of women as they find their strength to live authentic lives free of abuse.
"I wanted to use [The Courage to be Me] to reach out the person who has never talked to anyone about their abuse-the person who isn't ready to phone a helpline or get counseling," Burrowes shared. "This book is my way of gently explaining some of the psychology about abuse and illustrating the fact that you're not alone and you're not broken."

Full text:   Bowled over
I was delighted to read the Jan. 21 article by Carrie Maxwell entitled "Affinity kicks off 20th-anniv. year with Burning Bowl Event."
I'd Like to publicly thank and congratulate Affinity Community Services on its 20 years of organizational history, which, I must add, was built upon strong grassroots organizational skills and experience.
Affinity continues to be an organizational beacon of Light among the vast non-collaborative organizational emptiness that unfortunately exist among many organizations that purport to empower Black Lesbian, bisexual and transgender women and LGBTQ youth of African descent in the Chicago metropolitan area.
I can personally attest to Affinity's Longstanding commitment to community service and social justice; Longtime members that immediately come to mind are Lisa Pickens & Chris Smith, both having volunteering their time, money and organizational expertize for more than 20 years. They've donated not only to affinity's organizational efforts, but to many LGBTQ Chicagoans, especially those who Live on the South and West sides of Chicago.
Unfortunately, the sexism that exists within the broader LGBTQ organizational Leadership is mirrored in African-American LGBTQ organizational Leadership, and too often, results in barriers to gender-inclusive organizational collaborations.
Since 2009, Executive Director Kim Hunt's implementation of Affinity's various organizational programming includes the proposed "Civic 101 workshops as well as past programs such as the Domestic Violence Sunday sermons, the "It Takes a Village" program and the various research projects. These are all perfect examples of how a grassroots community-service organization's vision can be relevant, Long-term and sustainable. It can, most importantly, proactively engage those they purport to represent!
Sincerely,
Michael O'Connor

Full text:   Anyone who identifies as LGBTQ has good reason to be wary of the criminal justice system, but the Cook County state's attorney's office has stocked the ranks of its victim assistance program with at Least one ally.
Alida Oeseris the state's attorney's LGBTQ and hate crimes specialist. When a case opens that clearly falls under either umbrella, it finds her desk. Oeser offers victims support and resources and helps walk them through the complicated Legal process of the felony courts.
Oeser stepped into the position in September, following in the footsteps of Anne Huffman, who held the job for nine years.
Oeser was a sociology graduate student at DePaul University. She ran the rape crisis hotline for the YWCA Metropolitan Chicago and worked simultaneously as the sexual violence support services coordinator at DePaul. Most recently, she worked for Family Rescue, a domestic violence agency on the South Side.
Windy City Times sat down with Oeser to talk about her role, its challenges and how she supports victims in the criminal Legal system.
Windy City Times: How is it that you discovered this position and why did you pursue it?
Alida Oeser: This position was kind of an accident. I didn't mean to get into this. I've been doing rape crisis counseling work and domestic violence work, and it's not necessarily what I wanted to do forever. So having the opportunity to take this position that allows me to be more active in what I consider to be my community, needing advocacy services and that kind of representation - that was really exciting for me.
WCT: What were some of the driving factors that made it feel like this was the right position whether personally or professionally?
AO: Personally, being in the LGBT community, you see it every day, how much of a struggle it is to be received, Like LegitimateLy, in your experiences in non-LGBT communities, whether it's the doctor's office, the Legal system, domestic vioLence sheLters. Wherever you're going, you have to reaLLy push to be treated in a way that feels respectful to you ... . I feeL very strongly that speaking up and being abLe to make a negative experience any more positive is what I want to be doing - taking someone who's having this horribLe situation and being abLe to walk them through it in a way that's as painLess as possible, where they're getting as much respect as possible, because they deserve it.
WCT: What is one of the key components of your role?
AO: Having access to the right Language to make sure I'm not accidentally alienating somebody by using terms with the wrong gender pronouns or anything Like that. So that's kind of my job, to make sure those conversations are happening with victims in a way that is totally sensitive to them. And that's always been true for me, regardless of my work, is Letting [the victim] Lead the conversation. I don't need to address somebody in my Language. You go ahead and set that tone and I'LL use your Language, and that's cool. To me, that's just being a good advocate.
WCT: Are you someone that victims have to specifically request?
AO: If you don't disclose that you are a member of the LGBTQ community, then no, you're not necessarily getting referred to me, and that's cool, because you don't have to have the LGBTQ advocate just because you're part of our community. I'm here as an option for peopLe, to give them a choice to know that they do have me as a resource.
That's my job, to have LGBT-specific referrals to other parts of our community, whether it's entertainment, or counseling, or dvil Litigation services, heaLth services. To some extent we do expect peopLe to be their own advocate and ask for that if necessary. There are some cases where they don't have to. If it is dear in the case summary that this was a romantic relationship between two same-sex peopLe, that's automatica^ coming to me. And I don't need to make that a big deaL. That's not the conversation we have to have. The conversation is about you and whatever services you need to feel supported. Sometimes that's going to be LGBT-specific, and sometimes that's not.
WCT: Is lack of disclosure one of the bigger roadblocks in your job thaf s beyond your control?
AO: I wouLd say so, because we can onLy pursue cases that peopLe teLL us about. So, if somebody doesn't report the case to Law enforcement, it will never get to me. I will only see it once it's charged, but if they don't want to report it, it's not going to come up, because it can't come through the court system without first stopping at the poLice station.
There are peopLe who Live in communities where they might feeL Like they're engaging in an artivity that is not going to be approved of by a poLice officer. So, I don't want to go forward about this crime that happened to me if I'm worried that they're going to be Like "weLL, why were you doing that anyway?" or "you shouldn't have been doing that anyway" or possibly "I might arrest you, anyway." There are so many concerns about just that initiaL step that, yeah, I certainly feeL a LittLe powerLess to be abLe to move that forward, because I can't control what their experience is Like at that LeveL.
WCT: Talk about the one-on-one dynamic you have with the people that you're helping.
AO: There are things that are common across aLL of these. The No. 1 most important thing I can do for anyone is Listen to them, being able to Let someone sit across from me as Long as they need to, give me as much or as LittLe information as they want, and I'm going to be abLe to provide them that space, judgment-free. And I think that that's incredibly usefuL for peopLe who are feeling unsafe and possibly unwelcome where they're at. I want to Look at it holisticaLLy, not just how is the gay part of them feeling about this.
And then it's my job to give them options and say "here's what I hear you saying" and "I think this might be usefuL to you" and "wouLd you be comfortable if I made this connection for you?" Giving them something, knowing that when they Leave me they're not on their own, is my goaL. But every situation ends up differently, because it reaLLy is based on what the person sitting across from me feels most comfortable with. Maybe today you don't want resources, but maybe in a coupLe weeks you will, and that's cool. I can check in with you, I can ask you, but at the end of the day I want it to be up to you, what you're getting out of this.
WCT: What are the biggest challenges that LGBTQ individuals face in the legal system?
AO: The Legal system is going to be complicated for anyone, espedalLy a victim of crime. I can't articulate how challenging it is to go through and not feel traumatized by your experience, not because peopLe aren't doing a great job, that's not it at aLL. But the experience itself is daunting and you're kind of passed around aLL the way up the criminal justice system. So, that means you have to talk about what happened to you over and over again, and the way peopLe respond to your story is not aLways going to be what feels best for you.
Then for people in the LGBTQ community, having to worry about - from the beginning aLL the way up - if peopLe are going to take you seriously, if they're going to beLieve you, if they're going to harass you. What if they're homophobic? If you have to ask yourseLf aLL these questions, you're starting off feeling Like, "I don't wanna be here." I can't bLame anyone for coming in feeLing Like that, because at the end of the day, you shouldn't have to be here. This shouldn't have happened to you, period. And then to be passed from one person to the next to the next to the next, it continues to feel disempowering.
That's part of what I see my job to be, is being abLe to bring you back into this experience, so it's not just other peopLe teLLing you what to do - it's up to you also. But I don't know that that's going to work for everyone. There are plenty of peopLe who come in and aren't responsive, they don't want that. Because reaLLy, at the end of the day, I might just be another person they've been passed aLong to because they didn't seek me out. I come to them, I say, "I'm here as an option." Some peopLe wiLL take me up on it and some peopLe won't.
WCT: Has it been challenging for you to be part of a system that oftentimes doesn't work as it theoretically should?
AO: Yes, that's absolutely challenging to me. I don't know of a perfert system at this point, so ifs hard to say what would be preferabLe. There are Lots of things that give me pause in terms of how are we treating peopLe, whether there is enough restorative justice going on, I absoLutely think those conversations shouLd be happening and are happening. It's not necessarily helpfuL to just Lock that person up and throw away the key. It's never going to get better if we don't talk to peopLe, if we don't come to a mutual understanding about résped and about our humanity. But I think the position I'm in and the position that our office is in is a piece, and it's meant to be a piece. I don't think it's meant to be the end of the Line. I do think that there's some element up to us as being members of the community to take it beyond that.
WCT: Other than knowing that you're available if something should happen, how else can people use you as a resource?
AO: I'm available for questions, too. If somebody has a question about what do I do and maybe they don't feel comfortabLe talking to law enforcement right away, they can call me. I may not absoluteLy have the answer but I might abLe to dired them to someone who can that I trust to answer that question. I want people in our community to be abLe to use me as a resource beyond just "something horribLe has happened to me and now I am in need of your immediate assistance."

Full text:   Violence and gay mate relationships
Dear Editor:
As members of the Anti-VioLence Project at Center on HaLsted, we find ourseLves moved to respond to the remarks of Esera TuaoLo printed in the July 4 issue of Windy City Times in an interview titLed "Esera TuaoLo: Coming back from darkness."
TuaoLo discusses an incident of physicaL violence that took place with his intimate partner: "I got into an argument/fight with my boyfriend at the time. Things escalated and we got into a fight for personaL reasons." TuaoLo then provides his opinion that domestic-violence response systems are designed "to protect women or weaker people from an abusive boyfriend, husband, or stronger person who constantLy beats them up, but in this case, it was two men who got into a fight."
We are disturbed by TuaoLo's comments and even more disturbed that they are widely accepted. There are many probLems with TuaoLo's statements, which we would Like to parse in order to provide education and work to promote healing for individuals and communities struggling around domestic/intimate partner violence.
For one, TuaoLo cannot get away with thinking that his is not a case of intimate partner violence [IPV] (also caLLed domestic violence [DV]), aLthough we may not know about the existence of a pattern. According to the NationaL Coalition of Anti-VioLence Programs, domestic vioLence is defined as a pattern of behaviors utilized by one partner (often LabeLed the "abuser" or "batterer") to exert and maintain controL over their partner(s) (the survivor(s) or victim(s)).
Domestic violence is a widespread probLem. Statistics show that domestic vioLence occurs regardless of gender identity and sexuaL orientation, with studies suggesting that LGBTQ peopLe may even be at a higher risk for abuse compared to the one in four heterosexual· women who are abused by partners during their Lives. TuaoLo attempts to normalize, condone and/or excuse the vioLence he perpetrated by rhetoricaLLy separating his actions aLong seLf-perceived gender Lines while diminishing the dynamics of an intimate partnership: "women or weaker peopLe" are the abused and the "boyfriend, husband, or stronger person" does the beating, and Let's forget the part about "boyfriend". ..now it's just "two men" who "got into a fight." And to top it off, there is the perception that there are no services for him and/or his boyfriend to end violence in their relationship: "men," it would seem, don't need to be "protected]."
We know from our work, from our Lives and from our colleagues around the nation engaged in similar anti-violence efforts both against and within the LGBTQ community, that aLL peopLe regardless of gender identity and/or expression, sexuaL orientation, body-size, financial privilege, race, ethnicity, age, etc. may have problems with power and controL dynamics in an intimate partnership, as a perpetrator and as a survivor. If we have Learned anything as a community, Let it be to work against stereotypes that siLence those who are marginaLized and chaLLenge systems of oppression.
VioLence is not reducible to stereotypes, neither are the vieti m /survivors and perpetrators. SeLf-identified and cuLturaLLy perceived "twinks" can beat up, staLk, rape and murder their seLfidentified and cuLturaLLy perceived "big muscLe daddy" boyfriends. Self-identified and cuLturaLLy perceived "girLy-girl femme Lesbians" can do the same to their partners, even if their partners identify as butch/masculine/maLe. Likewise, if two partners who seem to be of similar physicaL ability chose to use violence against each other, that vioLence does not magicalLy canceL itself out. It is not excusabLe. It is not "male." And it shouLd not be eroticized or fetishized by others.
UnfortunateLy for members of the LGBTQ community, there are far fewer resources and more barriers to services (both rea L and perceived). There may be greater fear of trusting Law enforcement, there are no DV sheLter beds for maLes in Chicago, and there are fewer DV/IPV support services that work with the LGBTQ community. It takes a community to advance heaLing around the issues presented in TuaoLo's interview. CaLL out vioLence where you see violence; advocate for funding to support anti-vioLence programs such as the one at Center on HaLsted; and reach out if you are struggling around power and controL dynamics in your relationship. CaLL the Center on HaLsted Anti-Violence Project at 773-8712273 (CARE) to attend to safety needs and get linked to resources. Remember, the estimates are one in four. You are not alone and there is he Lp.

Abstract: Ironically, homosexuality has been legal in Haiti since 1986. But few protections and provisions come with it. For example, same-sex marriage, and civil unions are not recognized. Ifs unclear whether lGBTQ couples can adopt children or have custody of their own children. lGBTQ Haitians don't openly serve in the military.

Full text: Since the world community has descended on Haiti with relief aid in response to the Jan. 12 earthquake, I am wondering how Haiti's lGBTQ communities are being helped.
As one of Haiti's most marginal groups the question arises in response to how some American lGBTQ New Orleans were treated during the Hurricane Katrina relief effort in 2005.
During Hurricane Katrina former President George W. Bush's conservative faith-based organizations - like the Salvation Army, Catholic Charities and all other organizations in Bush's "armies of compassion" - highlighted how after the storm homophobia blew in.
While seemingly invisible in the disaster, many lGBTQ evacuees of Katrina and their families faced discrimination at the hands of those conservative faith-based relief organizations because of their sexual orientation, gender identity and/or HIV status.
'Tragedy does not discriminate and neither should relief agencies," stated Kevin Cathcart, executive director of lambda legal, in a news release in 2005. "In our experience during the aftermath of Sept. 11, lGBT people face compounded difficulties because on top of the disaster, they face discrimination when it comes to recognizing their relationships, leading to even more hardship at the worst moment imaginable."
My concern is will many of these same conservative faith -based relief agencies that are now in Haiti transfer their homophobic attitudes onto Haiti's lGBTQ citizens.
Ironically, homosexuality has been legal in Haiti since 1986. But few protections and provisions come with it. For example, same-sex marriage, and civil unions are not recognized. Ifs unclear whether lGBTQ couples can adopt children or have custody of their own children. lGBTQ Haitians don't openly serve in the military. They don't have anti-hate-crime bills that specifically addresses discrimination and harassment lGBTQ Haitians face on the basis due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. Minimally, lGBTQ Haitians are protected under its Constitution as stated in Artide 35-2 that prohibits discrimination in the workplace based on, "sex, beliefs, opinions and marital status." And the United Nation's International Bill of Human Rights mainly protects lGBTQ Haitians. With no queer enclaves in Port-au-Prince and other big cities throughout Haiti, many lGBTQ Haitians are left puzzled by what it means that homosexuality is legal in their country.
However, as in all repressively homophobic cultures, lGBTQ people have always found ways to express and to live out their true authentic lives. In Haiti, how openly queer you are depends not only on your class, profession and skin complexion, but also your religious affiliation.
In a country that is predominately Roman Catholic homosexuality is condemned. But among Haiti's lGBTQ middle and profession classes they find ways to socialize out of the public "gaydar" and with impunity.
For example, in Petionville, an upscale suburb of Port-au-Prince of mostly American and European whites and multiracial Haitians, is where many lGBTQ people will informally gather for dinner parties, at restaurants and beaches. The well-known four-star tourist hotel, the Hotel Montana in the hills of Petionville that was recently destroyed by the quake, is one of the hot spots. And these queers hold positions as government officials, business people, NGO and UN aid workers.
For the poorer classes of lGBTQ Haitians who live, work and socialize in the densely populated and improvised capital city of Port-au-Prince, discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender expressions is commonplace. The 2002 documentary Des Hommes et Dieux (Of Men and Gods) by anthropologist Anne lescot exposed the daily struggles of Haitian transwomen. Blondine in the film said, "When people insult me because I wear a dress I am not ashamed of how I am. Masisis (gay males) can't walk down the street in a wig and dress."
But poorer classes of lGBTQ Haitians do have at least two ways to openly express and celebrate who they are-in Vodou and in Rara festivals.
Although the universal perception of Vodou is the Hollywood stereotype of an orgiastic ceremony ritualizing the malevolent powers black magic, and engaging in cannibalism, Haitian Vodou is an ancestral folk religion that expresses an acceptance of all people of all sexual orientations and gender expressions.
With the belief that behavior is guided by a spirit (loa), gay males in Haitian Vodou are under the divine protection of Erzulie Freda, the spirit of love. And as a feminine sprit, gay males are allowed to imitate and worship her. And lesbians (madivins) are considered to be under the patronage of Erzulie Dantor, a fierce protector of women and children experiencing domestic violence. Dantor is bisexual, but she prefers the company women.
At Rara Festivals, a yearly festival that begins following Carnival belongs to the peasant and urban poor of Haiti. The Rara bands come out of Vodou societies that have gay congregations where gay men are permitted to cross-dress with impunity.
It is my hope that the many conservative faith-based groups and organizations that are now part of Haiti's earthquake relief effort will not discriminate against Haiti's lGBTQ community as many of them did toward New Orleans's queer communities during Katrina.
And it is my hope they remember that engaging acts of goodwill are needed in the face of this natural disasters and they must be inclusive of all of God's people.
