Full text: By now, everyone should have received a mailing from the U.S. Census Bureau to get counted. I have complicated feelings about the census.
While the census is critically important to ensure a fair allocation of funding for services and political representation, it will not deliver the full acceptance and freedom of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community. After all, it's a government survey. It will not capture the breadth of human experience in America today. So why are my feelings about it " complicated?
If s about me and who I am
Some aspects of my identity are reflected in the census. I'm gay. There is no census question asking about sexual orientation. Yet, the relationship question counts same-sex married spouses and unmarried partners. While being a same-sex couple is a poor proxy for sexual orientation, the 2010 census uncovered more than 700,000 same-sex couples in the United States.
I'm a dad of an adopted African-American child. Many LGBTQ people build families through adoption. The census counts transracial families. In fact, every year census data is used to allocate $8 Billion for foster care and adoption assistance that can help queers start families.
But it doesn't reflect my community
At the same time, my community is erased. Trans and gender non-conforming people must respond to a binary sex question. They must choose between their sex assigned at birth or how they identity to-day. The census asks about biology, not identity, and today while Facebook has more than 52 genders, the U.S. government only has two. It sucks.
Even India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Washington and Oregon states recognize a third gender. I and my organization, the National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance (NQAPIA), have urged the Census Bureau to recognize all of our community.
If s critically important
In the midst of the C0-VID 19 pandemic, health care is especially critical. The census is used to allocate $311 Billion in medical assistance annually, according to the George Washington University Institute for Public Policy. More resources flow to where there is greater need based on the relative size of the population.
I teach a class on Asian American queerness at Hunter College CUNY. So many of my students benefit from the $29 billion in financial aid (Pell Grants) for college every year.
I came out in the 1980s, at the height of the AIDS crisis. When I was in ACT UP, I fought hard to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. The census continues to be used to allocate $645 Million in HIV funding.
I could go on and recount the importance of an accurate census:
-$457 million for community mental health services
-$133 million for domestic violence prevention programs that guard against same-sex intimate-partner violence
-$48 million for community arts programs and for queer and trans artists
-$4.7 mMillion to prevent abuse, neglect and exploitation of elders
The more people who respond to the Census, the more likely resources will flow to under-resourced communities.
If s about political power and influence
But for me the most important aspect of the Census is the political influence that the data drives. The census can be a check on the outsized political influence that some intolerant states command when apportioning congressional seats among the states based on population.
Census data is also used to redraw Congressional, State Legislative and City Council district boundaries to make them equal in population. Sure, some districts can be gerrymandered. But voting rights advocates can also use the data to draw districts that give communities of color, and those who have be traditionally underrepresented, a voice in the halls of power.
If s mandatory and ensuring safety
The census is required by law. People can be fined $100 for not responding. Federal law also ensures that personal information is private and may not be shared with the immigration service, IRS, or law enforcement.
I am a lawyer. I reviewed the law and was delighted to find that the confidentiality protections have been upheld and strengthened by the courts. Yet, even in light of the strict penalties for those who violate the protections, I am still concerned.
NQAPIA is monitoring the census to keep our community safe. We have lawyers ready to sue if there are breaches and who are available to answer questions. You can report problem to us at http://bit. ly/2ULyiLy.
The way I see it, getting LGBTQ people to participate in the census is ultimately about harm reduction. The data collected inherently underrepresents the multiplicity of our identities. It can feel reductive and often dehumanizing, but it is necessary because of the very real implications towards how the government will allocate resources and representation. The census holds a lasting impact. To be missed is to be gone for the next ten years.
Let's be counted.

He is executive director of the National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance (NQAPIA)-a federation of LGBT Asian American, South Asian, Southeast Asian, and Pacific Islander organizations.

Full text: Headnote REVIEW
Netflix had perfect timing when the media company released Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness on March 20. Because of a pandemic that trapped television viewers at home like animals in cages, audiences had time to cram down a seven-episode story arc about the world of big-cat owners.
The welcome distraction left some people astounded and many ravenous for more. Sex, drugs and country music are all part of a new zoo revue that covers animal parks and various owners' interactions with each other throughout the years.
Co-producers/co-creators Eric Goode and Rebecca Chaiklin wanted a big-cat version of the award-winning documentary Blackfish and instead ended up with a very entertaining character study. There's something for everyone in Tiger King-and that's why it resonates so well with viewers.
The LGBT community pops up throughout the documentary. The star of Tiger King- Joseph Maldonado-Passage, also known as "Joe Exotic"-is a gay, gun-toting polygamist zoo owner hungry for fame. Exotic's past husbands are a mix of gay, bisexual and straight. One of Exotic's employees, Saff Saffery, is trans and prefers he/his pronouns. Unfortunately, in Tiger King, Saffery not only loses a limb, but is identified incorrectly several times.
After traveling to the Big Cat Rescue in Florida myself, I noticed how small-and far away from the public-the cages were located. In the program, owner Carole Baskin makes the case that the park is helping abused and abandoned big cats while charging customers to enter. If this is true, then she is making a killing along the way, after starting the project in 1992. Baskin is a fascinating character in Tiger King; she was ahead of the curve in terms of social media and even made a virtual-reality zoo last year. Is she a gentle animal lover or an evil genius who killed her husband in some way? These are questions that have both hooked viewers and have resulted in a new investigation against her.
Exotic is still behind bars and loving the attention-while serving 22 years. Now there's even talk of a possible presidential pardon for his sentence.
Lovers of animals have been skittish about watching the series, although another doc- Don't F**k With Cats: Hunting An Internet Killer, on the same platform-is much tougher to watch. The focus is mainly on the human subjects, and that's where Tiger King only scratches the surface of the real problem. While it can be fun to see the eccentric and vengeful cast of characters in Tiger King, the series really lost sight of being about the animals. Don't worry "all you cool cats and kittens," there's still meat on the bone, with a storyline of misused employees and an underworld of crime. The creators of Tiger King didn't complete everything they set out to do, but they have made a highly watchable tiger tale that is must-see TV.
The catty adventure continues with The Tiger King and I, a new after-show that was released April 12.

Full text: Headnote ELECTIONS 2020
Levander Smith Jr. is in a unique position.
It's his first campaign for Cook County Circuit Court judge-but he already sits on the bench.
In February 2019, the Illinois Supreme Court appointed Smith as a judge (in the domestic-violence division), with a term set to expire Dec. 7, 2020. Therefore, in order to retain his seat, he has to run for office (in the Larsen vacancy, so called because Judge Diane Larsen retired, paving the way for Smith to be appointed). However, it turns out that he also holds another judgeship.
Windy City Times: You're already a judge, but you're running for a vacancy.
Levander Smith Jr.: Yes. I applied for an associate judgeship in 2017; that process didn't start until 2018.1 was selected to be among the finalists and-from what I understand-for the first time in Cook County history, I tied with a guy for the last position (the 17th slot). I again applied for an associate judgeship and I waited patiently for that round to take hold again-and then I was called in February [2019] to fill a vacancy for someone who retired during her six-year term. So I'm completing her term, but I have to be in that number, so to speak [laughs], in order to keep my position for the next six years as a circuit-court judge.
In the process of campaigning for this circuit-court position, I was blessed to not only make the short list for the associate round but also to get an associate position, so I [was sworn in] on Jan. 6 as an associate judge. I know it's a bit confusing. [Laughs] And if I win the primary in March, I'll be back on my way to being a circuit-court judge.
WCT: So how does that hierarchy work?
LSJ: Circuit-court judges are elected by the people; associate judges are selected by circuit-court judges-so I did vote for myself. [Laughs] It's weird, I know.
The [circuit-court judges] make a little more money and, more importantly, have more voting power.
WCT: Your website says you've "[focused] most of his career fighting to protect children and families." Do you believe a judge can be an advocate?
LSJ: No-a judge is not an advocate. That phrase is from when I was an attorney. I worked for DCFS.
[Advocacy] is one of the temptations to overcome when you're a new judge. You want to advocate certain cases and people, but you must remain neutral. When it boils down to it, it's about the law and the facts of the case.
WCT: How did your Victory Fund endorsement come about? [Note: The Victory Fund endorses LGBTQ political candidates.]
LSJ: That's another blessing. [Laughs] I was advised to apply and completed the application process and-lo, and behold-there were a couple phone interviews, and I was selected. I was so happy to receive that endorsement because I knew that one of my colleagues received the endorsement as well, and I was so happy for her.
WCT: What do you think are the most significant issues affecting the LGBTQ community?
LSJ: Well, I sit in domestic-violence court and I see a number of same-sex couples there as well as members of the trans community. The worst violence I've ever seen has been with [LGBTQ] couples. The threats are so pervasive with members of the trans community.
WCT: This is your initial campaign. Whafs been the most surprising thing so far?
LSJ: [Laughs] In addition to the amount of time and money spent? The lack of sleep. But it's all good because I get to meet a lot of good people. People are fundamentally good, even though you hear so much on the news.
WCT: You're running against two other people in the Democratic primary. Whafs your biggest advantage in this race, and whafs your biggest disadvantage?
LSJ: One advantage-which I just discovered a few days ago-is that I'm listed first on the ballot. I'm told that there have been studies done that show that people tend to vote for the person listed first. I also think I stand out in that I offer more diversity than my opponents, being a man of color who is openly gay.
My biggest disadvantage? That I'm a man of color. I've seen a lack of victories for people of color county-wide.

Full text: Headnote BOOKS
One of the biggest struggles within activist movements is that they tend to emulate the institutions and power structures they are trying to change. For instance, within the feminist movement, organizations tend to be led by white, middle-class, heterosexual women. So, how can movements break out of those structures and make real change in society?
In her new book, Feminist Accountability: Disrupting Violence & Transforming Power, Ann Russo explores this idea.
Russo, an associate professor in women's and gender studies at DePaul University, has been involved in activism for most of her life in the areas of queer, antiracist, and feminist movement building.
"A lot of my work over the last 30 to 40 years has been within movements and organizations to end interpersonal and intimate violence as well as community violence and state violence," she said.
"I felt like sometimes the work we were building, the organizations we were building, the policies we were pushing for, became more and more institutionalized over the course of the movement's work3Afrom the '60s to the 2000s. Increasingly, that institutionalization made it so that we were sometimes participating in systems that were producing the very violence we were trying to dismantle."
As an example, Russo said the more mainstream part of the feminist anti-violence movement became "really invested in the criminal legal system" by pushing for things like mandated reporting and more criminalization of different kinds of behaviors.
At the same time, she was also seeing a push in society at large towards increasing the power of the prison industrial complex and the power of the police in responding to behavior that previously hadn't been considered criminal.
Ultimately, the results were perpetrating more violence on already vulnerable communities such as people of color, immigrants, and queer and trans individuals.
"The way we were creating things often recreated the hierarchies that we were also saying we were trying to dismantle," Russo said.
She said an easy way to understand this is to consider interpersonal and intimate partner violence within LGBT relationships and the responses to dealing with that violence, mainly, calling police.
"Relying on a system that has been actively brutal to queer LGBT people, particularly queer and trans people of color or immigrant communities, the police and prison system, those are places that have produced violence against queer and trans communities, relying on them can increase the violence against people."
Russo said by relying on the criminal-justice system, which focuses on the individual, "what happens within a racist, classist and xenophobic system is the people who mostly get charged with that violence are people of color, poor people and queer, trans and gender non-binary people."
She added, "It's also a problem because a lot of people trying to face the violence by people they know and love, they don't want to go to the police or to a system that is also oppressing them. If someone is surveilling you and your community and is criminalizing you every day, and you experience violence from someone you love and care about, they [the police] aren't going to be the people you look to for safety."
Russo said she sees accountability and transformative justice as a way forward. A way to acknowledge power structures and challenge them within movements so that real change can happen. She said this form of thinking allows for creative approaches outside of the criminal legal system. Russo envisions a world where communities can work outside of the criminal legal system and prison industrial complex to hold the individual who has caused harm accountable but more importantly, address the system that created the environment for that violence in the first place and disrupt it.
Russo will be at Women & Children Firs, 5233 N. Clark St., on Friday, Feb. 8, at 7 p.m. Her book is available through NYU Press, Amazon, Target and other retailers.

Full text: A report published by Chicago's Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law shows that while coverage of the incidence of sexual abuse in Chicago Public Schools has spurred critical dialogue around how school officials respond to students who've experienced gender-based violence, there are widespread blind spots to domestic and sexual violence in schools all over Illinois.
The report underscores the what it calls current inadequacies in Illinois schools that can hold student survivors back. Among the report's findings:
-Most schools lack a written policy or customary protocol for school personnel to deal with revelations of domestic and sexual violence.
-Despite a 2007 Illinois law requiring training for teachers, guidance counselors, and other school personnel likely to deal with students who've survived domestic and sexual violence, training is not taking place.
-School personnel often respond inappropriately to vulnerable students who disclose their experiences, and breach confidentially by publicly sharing details of students' experiences.
-School officials' inexpert responses result in intrusive questioning and peer bullying of survivors.
-Many student survivors are left to fend for themselves in the wake of their trauma and, as a result, miss classes, move schools or drop out.
The report's findings are based on four focus groups and 31 in-person and phone interviews conducted in 2015 and 2016; a total of 59 students (middle school and high school students) and service providers participated. The participants were diverse in terms of race, ethnicity and LGBTQ status; in addition, the participant service providers served diverse student populations.
The report calls for all K-12 schools across Illinois to develop survivor-centered, traumainformed policies for responding to the needs of students who are survivors of domestic or sexual violence.

Bishop Phyllis V. Pennese on leadership, 15-year anniversary

Full text: Bishop Phyllis V. Pennese, 61, recently celebrated her 15th anniversary as a minister at the church she founded in 2003, Pillar of Love Fellowship United Church of Christ (UCC).
"This has been a difficult but marvelous journey," said Pennese. "I have learned how to be a better pastor and pastoring has taught me how to be a better parent to my son, Brandon, and a better partner to my wife, Vickie. The anniversary service included friends, pastors, deacons and lay leaders from California, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Iowa.
"We celebrated with song, dance, praise, testimonies, great preaching and spoken word by local artist, activist and Pillar of Love founding member e. nina jay. It was a glorious time and I am so incredibly grateful and appreciative of all those who came from near and far to help us celebrate."
Pennese described her church as "radically inclusive and welcoming to everyone who wants to attend. It was founded to do outreach to those on the margins of society and the Black LGBTQ community specifically."
Pillar of Love's motto is "We live the love in our name and are courageous enough to be all God created."
This is a far cry from the church teachings Pennese heard during her youth as a member of the Pentecostal Church of God in Christ (COGIC). She called her childhood self a "Bible thumper."
Pennese grew up during the civil-rights era as a biracial child with an African-American mother and Italian immigrant father. She was part of the first wave of integrations during her elementary school years.
Everything changed when Pennese entered a local Catholic college and discovered a wider interpretation of faith through her exploration of other faith traditions. Pennese learned that the other people she met believed in God as much as she did. College was also where she discovered the lesbian scene, embraced her sexual orientation and went to her first gay bar, Augie & CK's.
Pennese said both her biracial and lesbian identities have formed much of how she views her faith and the wider world. This viewpoint and the fact that Pennese could not reconcile the anti-LGBT rhetoric she was taught as a child led her to leave the COGIC church and drop out of college. She spent the next 20 years "developing my feminist, womanist, lesbian self" through her involvement with Rape Victims Advocates (RVA). At first, Pennese was an RVA board member and volunteer doing rape crisis intervention and later, she served as one the organization's first paid staff members.
"I trained hundreds of women, and some men, in rape-crisis advocacy and was responsible for setting up rape-crisis advocacy programs in hospitals all over Chicago," said Pennese. "I also served as the Chicago Sexual Assault Services Network executive director and eventually worked with other organizations to do rape and incest survivor counseling."
While working at RVA, Pennese was asked by Rev. Delois Brown-Daniels to train some Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) students about rape, sexual assault and domestic violence. This led to Pennese attending a church service where Daniels was a guest preacher.
"Rev. Dee asked me to stand and introduced me to those gathered and said that people 'should get to know me and my ministry,'" said Pennese. "I remember thinking, 'who the hell is she talking about.' The anti-violence work I did was powerful and healing and in many ways spiritual but I had never thought of it as ministry until Rev. Dee said that."
Attending a revival at Trinity UCC, Pennese heard a sermon by Rev. Dr. James Forbes, who was LGBTQ-affirming. She also heard affirming messages at New Faith Baptist Church by Rev. Dr. Frank Thomas and joined the church after a few visits.
"I spoke to God about my sexual orientation and heard God affirm that God desired a relationship with me just as I was and that what was stopping me was me and other people but not God," said Pennese.
At New Faith Baptist Church, Pennese got involved as a leader and started ministry training. One of the rotations was in pastoral care which Pennese enjoyed so she started going to CPE classes herself.
"I applied for a Chaplain Intern Program at Northwestern Hospital and was accepted," said Pennese. "I flourished there and was told by the director that I should pursue a chaplain residency."
Pennese, with Dee's guidance, took on the challenge and was accepted into Advocate Christ Hospital's CPE Residency Program. She said she was surprised to be accepted since those residency programs were mostly offered to seminary students or graduates, of which she was not.
"When I completed that residency, I took a position at Advocate Hospice," said Pennese.
While at Advocate, Pennese applied and was accepted into the Master of Divinity program at Chicago Theological Seminary (CTS). She said CTS was the best fit for her due to the school's focus on teaching students how to think, that who one studies with is as important as what one studies and to ask who makes the rules and how can one change them.
Another pivotal moment for Pennese while she was at CTS was when she traveled to California with her wife to hear Rev. Yvette Flunder (now Bishop) preach.
"Hearing this powerful woman of God felt like looking in the mirror and seeing all of me for the first time, ever," said Pennese. "By this time I had had women ministers as role models and Black lesbians as role models but I did not know of anyone who embodied all of that and who demonstrated the love of God so profoundly. It was Bishop Flunder who took me under her wing and mentored, nurtured and encouraged me to birth Pillar of Love."
During this time, Pennese had switched her membership to Trinity UCC under Pastor Jeremiah Wright.
"Pastor Wright, of course, gave me his time, expertise and graciously shared his wisdom," said Pennese.
Pennese is also the Midwest Region Bishop for The Fellowship Of Affirming Ministries (TFAM) where she helps other pastors grow and develop as leaders.
Pennese and partner Vickie Sides celebrated their 20th anniversary this past May. They met when both were doing rape crisis work in Chicago.
"I would not be who I am nor would my work in ministry be as successful without her and our son, Brandon in my life," said Pennese.
Sides currently works as a University of Chicago administrator and as an adjunct professor at National Louis University.
"My entire life has been a great journey and I am excited to see and know what God has in store for me for the next 15 years" said Pennese.

Full text: Center on Halsted (the Center) and the UN Women Chicago chapter hosted a panel discussion, "Cultural Stigma of LGBTQ Domestic Violence," Oct. 4 at the Center to kick off its programming slate for Domestic Violence Awareness Month.
Panelists included American Indian Health Service of Chicago Youth Programs & Youth Social Work Director Lauren Miller; Domestic Violence Legal Clinic Staff Attorney and Invisible 2 Invincible: Asian/Pacific Islander Pride of Chicago (i2i) member Nebula Li; and Radhika Sharma Gordon, outreach and education manager for Apna Ghar, a services and advocacy group for immigrant communities dedicated to ending gender violence. The Center's Anti-Violence Project (AVP) Clinical Advocate Caitlin Tupper served as the event's moderator.
Tupper asked what stigmas and barriers each of the panelists encounter with the people they serve who are victims of domestic violence.
Sharma Gordon said there is a fear of coming forward due to many factors, including being undocumented, family shaming and the older generation not wanting to air their dirty laundry versus the younger generation.
Li explained that sometimes LGBTQ-identified domestic violence victims are not out to their parents or other family members; queer couples are most often in the same social group; and there are not a lot of services outside of the Center which makes it harder for people in faraway neighborhoods to get help.
Miller, who identifies as pansexual and is a member of the Mvsoke-Creek Native American tribe, said that the Native American population has the most instances of domestic violence and sexual assault per capita, but the statistics for queer people within that group are unclear. She explained that only 40 tribes acknowledge LGBTQ people in their individual Constitutions, so it is difficult for many queer Native people to be out about their sexual orientation and/or gender identity.
In terms of people's coming out challenges, Tupper questioned how each of their organizations are combating that issue.
Miller said they have a youth drop-in center and a website page dedicated to youth programming, while Li explained that at the Domestic Violence Legal Clinic they will be doing a Trans 101 session for staff this fall.
Sharma Gordon said her organization has worked to have the staff "check their biases at the door" so everyone who comes in their door will receive the same level of services. She explained that another way they show their inclusivity is with an LGBTQIA poster featuring many different languages that says, "Welcome here" that a former staffer made for their space.
Every panelist emphasized the urgency of assisting trans and gender nonconforming women of color that come to them for help, including providing them with safe spaces to share their stories. Miller spoke about her organization's recent move to the corner of Montrose and Lowell Avenues, where they will have gender neutral bathrooms.
Tupper asked about the dynamics of domestic violence where partners exert control that they see in their work.
Miller said that the victim is sometimes shunned by their tribe, including removing access to cultural practices. Li explained that there is often a language barrier where the victim is not allowed to learn English as well as the desire to not ruin the reputation of all Asians by reporting acts of domestic violence. Sharma Gordon spoke about immigration status being tied to marriage to one's abuser.
As far as a safety plan for LGBTQ domestic abuse survivors is concerned, Miller explained that validating their experience is key and respecting how they identify themselves is also important. Li said ensuring a survivor's confidentiality, and letting them lead the decision-making process- including using the same language they use to describe what happened to them-is also vital.

Full text: Headnote FALL THEATER PREVIEW
Google Artemisia Gentileschi's 17th-century oil painting Judith Beheading Holofernes. Seriously. Do it. I'll wait. The image is emblematic of Gentileschi's art: Magnificent, lush and thematically violent. It was also revolutionary: In 1600s art and life, the male gaze wasn't a thing, it was the only thing. So much so that for centuries after Gentileschi's death, her work was attributed to her male contemporaries.
"Nobody believed a woman painted like she did," said Artemisia Theatre Artistic Director Julie Proudfoot." "Critics and history ignored her signature, and credited various men with her paintings. They tried to erase her."
Proudfoot isn't one for female erasure, not in the 17th century and not today. With the sixplay Artemisia Fall Festival, she's putting plays about women in the limelight. "American theater clings to a white male perspective," said Proudfoot. "It does not embrace a feminist voice. And because of that, our culture is robbed of stories that aren't just great stories, they're universal." The fest's series of staged readings from Sept. 24 through Oct. 3 at the Edge Theatre, 5451 N. Broadway.
Statistics offer dismal proof off Proudfoot's assertion. According to American Theatre Magazine, men wrote close to two-thirds of all the plays produced in 2017. Women wrote 26 percent. Gender queer authors were all but statistically insignificant, coming in at .004 percent, (less than one half of one half of one half of one percent.)
Proudfoot recalled having an epiphany when trans actor/writer/activist Delia Kropp (https:// www.therealdelia.com/hr.html) spoke on a panel last spring.
"Delia said something that struck me so hard: 'I had no realization of how much privilege I had as a white man until I became a white woman,' " Proudfoot recalled. "It was an incredibly powerful moment."
Proudfoot often finds herself explaining that writing a female lead isn't enough. "I get submissions from writers who say, 'Oh, there are strong women in my play. Strong leads.' And they've written a strong hooker. Or a strong mother. Or a strong nice girl next door. We have more stories than that. Way more."
Shame, Proudfoot said, can silence those stories. Compared to rom-coms or sunny musicals, plays that take on "unpleasant" topics like rape or domestic violence are few. "We're shamed out of talking about these things," Proudfoot said. "Until fairly recently, we've haven't even dealt much with stories of women loving other women-whether it's a love affair or a deep friendship or a family that doesn't fit traditional gender roles. The gender stratification runs thick and deep."
Shame played a tragically significant role in the life of Artemisia Theatre's namesake. As a young teenager, Gentileschi was raped by one of her father's coworkers, Agostino Tassi. Her father prosecuted Tassi for theft of household goods, the goods being Gentileschi's virginity. Tassi was found guilty. His sentence was not enforced. For the rest of her work, Gentileschi's work often referenced acts of violence.
Working in Hollywood in the '90s and early Aughts, Proudfoot saw countless contemporary versions of that story play out. "I was there when Harvey [Weinstein] was in power. I had friends who called the [actors' union] hotlines. I saw women destroyed," she recalled of her days doing national ad campaigns and shows such as "The Gilmore Girls," "The Practice," and "The Cradle Will Rock."
When Proudfoot returned to Chicago in 2005, she found herself repeatedly auditioning for the same roles in different plays: "Moms who were the moral center, bitchy character parts, neurotic career women. It got frustrating," she said. In 2011, she founded Artemisia Theatre, driven partly by the lack of opportunities for women and partly by the overwhelming dominance of female characters created from a male point of view.
Artemisia's annual festival stands as both entertainment and a reclamation of female stories. Of the six festival plays, Proudfoot will select one to be fully produced next season. Her specs for women characters are clear: "I want women complex enough to have an inner world and an outer world. Women who go through a process of discovery, who learn to master both of those worlds," she said. "I want women who ultimately have agency."
Artemisia's Fall Festival runs at 7:30 p.m. Sept. 24-Oct. 3 at the Edge Theatre, 5451 N. Broadway. For more information, go to http:// artemisiatheatre.org.

Full text: Christa Leigh Steele-Knudslien was the first known transgender person to be killed in 2018. The 42-year-old was arguing with her husband, Mark Steel-Knudslien, when he stabbed and beat her to death. Christa was the founder of the Miss Trans America and Miss Trans New England pageants. Her friend, Justin, told NBC News that she wanted trans women to be seen as beautiful.
Since her murder, at least 15 more trans people have been killed in the United States. The latest were Sasha Garden, 27, of Orlando, Florida, and Diamond Stephens, 39, of Meridian, Mississippi.
We are in the midst of a crisis. Transgender people, especially trans women of color, are at an extremely high risk of violence. Last year, the Human Rights Campaign reported a record number of violence-based deaths of trans people: 28. The violence is not relenting.
Through an examination of data and conversations with experts, this investigative feature explores the threats trans and gender nonconforming people face every day. It investigates the motivations behind this violence and the identities of the perpetrators and the victims. It examines the cultural norms that have allowed so many trans people to live in danger for so long, and it addresses the information we still don't have. Finally, it acknowledges that change isn't possible overnight, but it is possible.
The Seeds of Violence
Why are trans people at such high risk of violence? There is no single answer, but experts say the seeds of this violence lie within the cultural and systemic devaluation of transgender lives and bodies.
"Ultimately, there aren't enough people that value and respect the humanity of other folks, especially trans folks and especially trans women of color," said Angelica D'Souza, the LGBTQ & Hate Crime Victim Specialist with the Cook County State's Attorney's Office. "At the end of the day, you're not going to perpetrate violence against somebody that you value as a person. That's the fundamental problem."
This lack of value our culture has for trans people is perpetuated through the basic rights we regularly deny them-like jobs, housing and healthcare.
The unemployment rate for trans respondents to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey was 15%, compared to a then 5% unemployment rate for the general U.S. population. In addition, 29% of respondents were living in poverty, compared to 12% of the general U.S. population, and 23% experienced housing discrimination within a year of the survey while 30% said they have been homeless at some point in their lives.
The survey also showed that 33% of respondents who visited a doctor within a year of the survey had a negative experience due to being transgender, and 23% did not visit a doctor when they needed to due to fear of mistreatment. In 2015, the Movement Advancement Project found that 15% of trans people earn less than $10,000 per year.
The continuous denial of basic rights for trans people not only maintains the stigma surrounding them, but it also physically places them in more danger by blocking their access to safe places to work, live and sleep. Twenty six percent of those who experienced homelessness within a year of the survey did not go to a shelter due to fear of mistreatment based on their gender identity, and 70% of those who sought refuge at a shelter said they were mistreated because they were transgender.
Lisa Gilmore, a licensed clinical professional counselor who focuses on LGBTQ-specific antiviolence, works from the theory that "the more social stigma somebody faces, the higher their vulnerability to violence and the lower their access to safety is. If we don't provide people with shelter and safety they are going to be more vulnerable to more severe violence and death," she said.
Trans people seeking refuge from an abusive partner or who are kicked out of their homes often have nowhere to turn. "They end up on the street or staying in the relationship," Gilmore said. "They're going to be at a higher risk for violence. When you're out and about all the time and doing what you have to do to survive, you are at risk for violence, you are at risk for people thinking you are less than somehow, therefore it is easier."
LaSaia Wade, founder and executive director of Brave Space Alliance, the first Black-led, transled, LGBTQ center on Chicago's South Side, believes people's discomfort with her Black, transgender body is a projection of their discomfort with their own bodies.
"What is it about my body that makes you so uncomfortable about your body?" Wade asked. "Is it because I'm living my truth and you're not living your truth? People don't want to look in their own mirror."
Wade believes people are afraid of being true to themselves. "People don't want to sit with that these days. That is not only killing my people, but it's killing everyone else. It's killing people leftand right and it's sure as hell fucking up this country."
Types of Violence
Trans people are at risk of many types of violence, but intimate partner violence (IPV) is one huge issue the community faces.
The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey found that 54% of respondents experienced IPV, with 24% having experienced severe physical violence at the hands of an intimate partner. This is 6% higher than the general U.S. population. Additionally, the 2016 National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs Intimate Partner Violence Report found that "Transgender women were 2.5 times more likely to be stalked, 2.5 times more likely to experience financial violence, and 2 times more likely to experience online harassment within IPV, compared to survivors who were not transgender women."
Even with IPV, though, anti-transgender bias can be involved. "I don't think violence against trans women is anything other than bias motivated," said D'Souza. "Because even when there are instances of domestic violence, from the folks that I've worked with I've heard things like, 'I outed him,' 'He got violent because people found out about who I was and that was unacceptable to him.' Or, 'no one was supposed to find out about me.' Or it's about toxic masculinity and it's about patriarchy and it's about all of those things and at the end of the day it often is because of this person's identity in one way or another."
According to Forge, a national transgender anti-violence organization, there are many abuse tactics used specifically against trans people in instances of intimate partner violence, such as threatening to out someone, hiding or throwing away hormones, and belittling their identity by telling them they are not a "real" woman or man. Additionally, what makes trans victims of IPV so vulnerable is their lack of access to services that could save them from their situation as well as the common fear of involving law enforcement.
In the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, 22% of people who visited a domestic violence shelter, a domestic violence program, or a rape crisis center at which the staffknew they were transgender were mistreated.
Forty seven percent of respondents to the survey also reported being sexually assaulted at some point in their lives. Trans people who have been homeless, those with disabilities, and those who have participated in sex work reported sexual assaults in even higher numbers.
PART TWO
What We Know: Who are the Victims?
Trans people of all genders are at risk of violence, but the combination of rampant transphobia, sexism and racism puts trans women of color in the most danger.
According to the 2017 A Time to Act report by the Human Rights Campaign and Trans People of Color Coalition, trans women are four times as likely to be the victims of homicide compared to the general population of women in the United States. Between 2013 and 2017, HRC and TPOCC have recorded 102 acts of fatal violence against transgender people. At least 88 of the victims were trans women and at least 87 of the victims were people of color.
According to the National Association of Anti- Violence Programs, violence against trans women of color is getting worse. The number of homicides of trans women of color has grown steadily over the past five years, from 12 hate violence homicides in 2013 to 22 in 2017 (though some reports are as high as 28).
Who are the perpetrators?
There are too many perpetrators of violence against trans people to name, too much data acknowledging the presence of attackers in the workplace, in public places, at home, in jails, in immigration detention centers. Trans people are attacked by police, by loved ones, and by strangers. Perpetrators of this violence are everywhere.
Tools of violence
The A Time to Act report found that of the 102 transgender homicides between 2013 and 2017, 61 of the victims died from gunshot wounds.
The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey found that, while 3% of overall respondents had been attacked with a gun in the past year, trans women of color were four times more likely to be attacked with a gun than other trans people. Those working in the underground economy were more than three times as likely to be the victims of gun violence and those with their only source of income being from the underground economy were more than five times as likely to have been attacked with a gun.
What We Don't Know
According to Naomi Goldberg, the Policy & Research Director at the Movement Advancement Project, there is no national government-sponsored survey that includes a question relating to trans people and their experiences.
While the FBI began collecting hate crime statistics in 2013, Angelica D'Souza, the LGBTQ & Hate Crime Victim Specialist with the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, said it is based only on data from states who are willing to report it. Beyond that, bad experiences with police and other law enforcement means many trans people likely do not report crimes committed against them at all. Fifty seven percent of respondents to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey said they would not be comfortable seeking help from the police.
"So much of the big systems-level response is based around reporting to law enforcement or reporting to victims services," said Gilmore. "So first of all, do you even feel like you can report it? Do you, as a transgender person, a transgender woman, recognize that these systems and laws also should be things that you have access to, that you have a right to support from, and a right for those places to be accountable to providing you with safety?
"Do you even think that based on your past experiences with other service providers or law enforcements or courts? Medical providers? What are all these reasons why you might not or why you might? And then how do those people respond to you? Do they mark it and indicate what kind of violence it is? Do they let you tell them what the violence is? Do they let you tell them how you identify? Does someone automatically put you in the category of male because they assume that you were assigned male at birth? If you say, I'm a woman, do they mark you as a woman or do they make a note that you're a transgender woman? Who knows? So yes, how do we get the data?"
Gilmore said the only way data is currently being collected is by organizations doing victims services who have created their own way to collect it and make it available. "So we're not getting a uniform way of collecting that data. It's hard to try to extrapolate, to say okay if we got 300 reports of violence against transgender women this past year what does that mean in terms of percentage? Well, we don't know. We don't know what to compare it to."
Additionally, standard domestic violence studies and surveys may not include a place for victims to identify themselves as anything other than male or female, which makes it very difficult to know whether trans women are included in stats about women on the whole. For example, the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey put out by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control breaks down all of their data by whether violence is happening to a man or a woman. The word transgender does not appear in their 2015 report.
PART THREE
The Services Trans People Don't Have
"You can't talk about violence against trans women and not talk about having decreased access to mental health services and decreased access to substance abuse services and decreased access to medical services and assault on immigrants," said Angelica D'Souza of the Cook County State's Attorney's Office. "It's all interwoven, and if you're somebody who is amongst the most that society marginalizes, you're even further excluded from services."
There is a massive need for more LGBTQ-affirming services, for more shelters, legal, and health services to provide gender-affirming support. "It's unacceptable that the places that in our society we have said are the places that are supposed to help survivors of violence often are places where LGBTQ people experience victimization again in forms of either discrimination or verbal violence or physical violence and sexual violence," said Gilmore.
She added some of the most important work she does is with organizations around policies for how their staffand volunteers work with LGBTQ people-essentially teaching them how to serve anyone who is not a cisgender woman. Most systems currently in place have been designed to exclusively keep cisgender women safe and do not have policies in place to help anyone else.
Even services that may be available to victims beyond cisgender women may not give the appearance that they are welcoming, said D'Souza. The Chicago Battered Women's Network, for example, alienates those who do not identify as women just by its name. And on the website of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, it calls itself "the vital link to safety for women, men, children, and families affected by domestic violence." Where does that leave trans and gender nonconforming people?
"There's a huge lack of competent care in the behavioral health and mental health fields," said D'Souza, "Even from folks that are LGBT affirming. Someone's whole life is not just that they're trans. People are whole people, so there's definitely a need for more competent and more affirming services, but there are definitely efforts underway that need support, that need money. Shit costs money, and without it it's hard to have a reach, but the folks who are doing the work are doing a lot of work with little money."
Regarding the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs 2016 Intimate Partner Violence Report, Emily Waters, NCAVP's Senior Manager of National Research and Policy, emphasized the need for community support and resources. "Rather than primarily focusing on prosecution of intimate partner violence as a "violent crime," as it is currently being framed by [U.S. Attorney General] JeffSessions, the Department of Justice should support and devote resources to LGBTQ organizations and groups that are working to address IPV from within the community," she said.
Gilmore agrees. "There's very little prevention resources for anti-LGBTQ violence that I know of," she said. "Most of the resources for victimization have to do with responding after victimization has already occurred. Most of the resources are built around these systems that broader society has set up that are about punishing and criminalizing and giving victims band aids and support and just get away from that person who is violent towards you."
The Services Trans People Do Have-in Chicago
Brave Space Alliance is the first Black-led, trans-led LGBTQ community center on the South Side of Chicago. According to LaSaia Wade, many trans victims of violence come to BSA for help. While BSA is not equipped to assist directly, they maintain a network of partnerships to domestic violence shelters, homeless shelters, and housing initiatives, all of which have undergone BSA's training in how to provide affirming services for trans people.
"We actually listen to what people need," Wade said, "and have that discussion with homeless shelters and push them to be politically aware of what's happening in the world."
BSA helps trans people with leadership development, access to jobs, and community, with the goal of creating a brave space where trans and queer people feel empowered to use their voices and speak out. For those on the West Side, Wade suggests Project Vida, and on the North Side, Howard Brown Health and its Broadway Youth Center.
Also on the West Side, Reyna Ortiz and her team do outreach work and programs through the TaskForce Prevention and Community Services. The Center on Halsted also has transgender services, as does Chicago House, through their TransLife and TransSafe programs.
Stopping the Violence
"Reducing violence is simpler than we think," said Wade. "Education." Educating people can happen in all sorts of ways. She emphasizes the need to educate people both beyond the LGBTQ community and within it-because discrimination happens within the community as well. The most productive conversations Wade has, she said, are with young people, who have not yet been "tainted" with prejudice. "If we start with our youth before any and everything," she said, "We don't have to worry about anything."
While we do need laws to change and we do need better policies, keeping trans people safe means doing more than that. It means fundamentally reshaping the way our culture views the transgender community. It means giving trans people access to jobs, healthcare and housing. It means honoring their pronouns and giving them representation in media as three-dimensional people who are more than their gender identities. It means raising children with a greater awareness of gender fluidity and teaching them not to hate what is different. Erasing a stigma that is so deeply embedded in society cannot happen overnight, but it must happen.
Wade acknowledges there has been some progress. "We're being seen in spaces we've never been seen," she said. "I am an ED. I have the chance to go into these spaces and push political knowledge. Most LGBT ED's are white or make $100,000 and above. So what does it look like when we have the same power? We might not have the same money, but what does it look like when we have the same power, saying yes or no in these physical spaces we normally do not have access to?"
Wade encourages more open and honest conversations in all communities about what people need to be their best and fullest selves. This, she believes, will begin to open the door for acceptance. "If the darkest, blackest trans woman is free," she says, "Everyone is free."

Full text: Dishing with Christine Ebersole and Seth Rudetsky
Listen to Seth Rudetsky's dishy Sirius/XM radio program Seth Speaks and you'll hear a mix of Broadway gossip, obsessively deconstructed showtunes and witty chit-chat. It's not always overt, but Rudetsky instills his shows with something else as well.
"Everything I do has a social-justice element," Rudetsky told Windy City Times during an brief interval between tapings, concerts and host/ emcee duties on luxury cruises aimed at fellow musical theater superfans. "I feel like anything artistic is part of the quote unquote resistance. That is obviously important right now."
On Monday, July 30, Rudetsky will bring his singular Broadway stylings the Steppenwolf Theatre for a 90-minute live show with two-time Tony winner Christine Ebersole (Grey Gardens; War Paint; 42nd Street; TV's Pose). The raconteur will interview the actress about her lives on and off the stage. It's a safe bet that Ebersole will punctuate the banter with numbers from her 40+year Broadway career.
"I always say I can get people to reveal things they haven't told anyone but their therapist," Rudetsky said. "I think that's because when they talk to me, even big stars realize things they're nervous about revealing aren't necessarily big deals. Plus, they know I'm not going to make them look bad. And P.S., I've been in therapy myself for 325 years."
Ebersole, a Winnetka native and New Trier alum, is arguably best known to Chicago audiences for playing Elizabeth Arden in War Paint opposite Patti LuPone's Helena Rubenstein. War Paint premiered at the Goodman Theatre in 2016 before going to Broadway. Ebersole and Rudetsky have been friends for decades, dating back to his days as a writer on the Rosie O'Donnell Show, where Ebersole was a frequent guest. They've performed together from New York to Provincetown, Massachusetts, as well as on the high seas during the "Big Fat Broadway Cruises" Rudetsky enthuses that he "absolutely loves, loves, loves."
"Seth's unbridled enthusiasm about Broadway is contagious," said Ebersole from her New Jersey home. "We always have a ball."
Like the free-wheeling interviews on Rudetsky's radio show, the Steppenwolf show isn't scripted. That said, Ebersole is more than likely to break out numbers from War Paint and Grey Gardens.
"What's interesting to me is hearing people put the songs they sing in context," Rudetsky said. "When you know what a song means to someone, what their history with it is-that makes it fascinating."
While Ebersole is a bona fide Broadway star, Rudetsky is the unofficial spiller of Broadway secrets. His knowledge of Broadway is encyclopedic, affectionate and acerbic. ("Christine's Broadway debut was in 1975. P.S.: The show closed two weeks after she joined the cast.")
On his radio show and in live performances, the fast-paced anecdotes range from hilarious to poignant. But along with wildly entertaining story-telling (Andrea McArdle's secret candy stash sending a rain of M&Ms skittering across the stage during a climactic moment in Les Miserables; Priscilla Lopez peeing onstage during A Chorus Line; Wicked's Shoshana Bean failing to defy gravity during Defying Gravity, thanks to a malfunctioning cherry picker), Rudetsky brings what he deems an "undercurrent" of social justice to his multiple platforms.
He's done countless fund-raisers for everything from synagogues to the Sierra Club. He's ramped up his efforts over the past two years, launching (with his husband, James Wesley) the Concert for America series.
"Every month since the presidential election, we've done a concert to raise money for the groups being targeted. The NAACP, the Immigration Law Center, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the National Coalition against Domestic Violence-I feel like I have the means to make a difference. So that's what I try to do," he said. With the all-star concert recording What the World Needs Now (available on iTunes), he's has raised more than $100,000 for Pulse victims.
The theater community itself isn't immune to the same sort of stereotyping that the larger world engages in, he said.
"Musical theater is full of gay people, but there are comparatively few actual gay characters in Broadway musicals who aren't the quippy side-kick," he said. "Every time I see a casting breakdown describing a 'flamboyant co-worker' or 'sassy best friend' I get angry," he said. "It's better now than it was-Falsettos was ground breaking. So was A Chorus Line and Applause. We've got Fun Home. But those kinds of characters are still very few and far between."
"Music and lyrics can open up a person's mind," he said. "They can also be amazingly entertaining."
Seth Rudetsky and Christine Ebersole will perform Monday, July 30, at Steppenwolf Theatre, 1650 N. Halsted St. Tickets are $50; visit Steppenwolf.org.

Full text: Filmmaker, writer and artist Lilly Wachowski's "Say Our Names" exhibit was featured at the Rush University Medical Center's 5th annual Pride Month reception June 20 on the Medical Center's West Side campus.
Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) LGBTQ Community Liaison Antonio King was the featured speaker. He invoked luminaries and trailblazers in the LGBTQ community such as Harvey Milk, Bayard Rustin, Audre Lorde, Jane Addams, Rock Hudson, Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera and Willi Ninja who made it possible for the many Pride Month celebrations that take place in Chicago.
King said he is charged with "enhancing the well-being of LGBTQ residents in Chicago, including equitable health care delivery."
"The LGBTQ Health and Outreach program addresses related quality of life issues, such as: unemployment, housing, safety, bullying, domestic and intimate partner violence and other quality of life challenges that ultimately affect the health of the LGBTQ community," said King. "We also address high rates of smoking and obesity, challenges that LGBTQ persons have in accessing care and other direct health concerns."
King said the CDPH is honored to be in a relationship with Rush, citing what he said was the important work the medical center does as well as its continued commitment to LGBTQ-inclusive policies for patients and employees. He said the CDPH is, for the first time, presenting sexual and gender minority health status data for LGBT youth and adults in Chicago in a report: The LGBT Health Databook.
This data is vital for Chicago's health improvement plan Healthy Chicago 2.0 because sexual and gender minorities are a priority population for a number of the plan's goals, said King. Additionally, King explained that Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the CDPH have committed to decreasing HIV infection rates with the Getting to Zero campaign. King said the campaign wants to have zero new infections and zero people living with HIV who are not receiving treatment by 2027.
Among the other speakers were; Rush University Medical Center and Rush System (Medical Center, Rush Oak Park Hospital and Rush Copley Medical Center in Aurora) President Michael Dandorph, Rush University Medical Center LGBTQ Leadership Council Co-chairs Brandy Hatcher and Christopher Nolan, Rush University Medical Center LGBTQ Employee Resource Group leader and LGBTQ Leadership Council member Billy Dishuk and Rush University Student Diversity and Multicultural Affairs Director Kate Webster.
Webster spoke about how great it is to be able to have a picture of her and her wife in her office because of Rush's LGBTQ-inclusive policies.
"When we have to cover parts of our identity we are not able to produce our best work," said Webster.
Dishuk said being gay has never been a barrier to him working at Rush.
Dandorph explained that Rush's commitment to diversity has a positive impact on the entire system and each year this event has grown in attendance (approximately 150 people this year). He also mentioned the steady increase in people from Rush marching in Chicago's Pride Parade over the past few years.
In terms of creating an environment that values diversity, Dandorph said the key is to include it in everything they do in the Rush system. One of the ways Rush does this is by having diverse patient and student populations. Dandorph explained that for ten years Rush in Chicago has held a leadership status with the Human Rights Campaign's Healthcare Equality Index (HEI) with a 100 percent score each year. He said Rush Oak Park has had a 100 percent score for the past five years while Rush Copley is on its way to achieving a 100 percent score.
Hatcher spoke about Rush's collaboration with Project Fierce, the existence of all gender bathrooms at the Chicago and Oak Park locations (they are working on having them at the Copley location) and the hospital's participation in this year's LGBTQ job fair at the Center on Halsted.
Nolan said the LGBTQ Leadership Council was created to move Rush to the next level. He explained that there is still more work to be done, especially in today's political climate where the Affordable Care Act is under attack, including the 1557 guidance that helps the LGBTQ community.
Speaking with Windy City Times, Wachowski explained that her family's history with the hospital goes back to when her mom worked there and has continued to this day, including her exhibit being displayed in Rush's Searle Conference Center until July 6.

Black women anti-rape advocates unite at UIC

Full text: "After Rosa, Before #MeToo"-a panel of the history of Black women's anti-rape organizing efforts-was a chance for four powerful women to commiserate on a subject they knew intimately. Organized by Keisa Reynolds of the University of Illinois at Chicago's (UIC's) Women's Leadership and Resource Center as part of its "Take Back the Fight" programming, Reynolds was inspired by reading a piece about how #metoo was not benefitting Black women, and realizing the author seemed unfamiliar with Black women's crucial efforts in the fight against sexual violence.
Mary Scott-Boria-a former member of the Black Panther party and, later, a women's health organizer-remembered not feeling like she had a language to talk about the rape she'd experienced when she was 20. "I did it because I was a community organizer," Scott-Boria said of her early anti-rape work. "I didn't even think of myself as a survivor."
Scott remembered "stumbling" into anti-rape organizing, a feeling the entire panel concurred with. Two of the women, Vickie Sides and Rachel Caidor, did not even feel like organizers, though Caidor said in college her dorm room was the unofficial rape-crisis center. "When I graduated high school, I didn't even know rape crisis counselor was a job you could get," she said.
Activist Mariame Kaba remembered calling a sexual-violence hotline she found in the phone book, and asking to be connected to other teen survivors. "You are in crisis and you need to figure out what is wrong with you," she remembered being told. "We have no place for you." Both she and Scott-Boria had spent formative years inside Black Nationalist movements that were highly sexist: Kaba's consciousness was raised in college by Angela Davis' Violence Against Women and the Ongoing Challenge to Racism.
All of the women had to confront both misconceptions about the work they started to do and internal struggles within their various communities. While the other panelists recalled forming a community around the YWCA, Kaba remembered feeling isolated from other women of color in her non-profit work, and increasingly uneasy about the role the state played in her work. The cops were never the first thing survivors asked for, she said, often because they didn't want their partners incarcerated. Had she continued in a nonprofit space, Kaba said, she would have eventually stopped doing the work.
Through her work with social service agencies, Caidor began to see the way conversations about domestic violence and rape were siloed, and among women of color, survivor identity was still developing. Working as a counselor in Logan Square, she found she "had to unlearn what they were taught," as clients treated her space more as a community center rather than for counseling. Caidor found that communities were already doing the healing and organizing she was supposed to provide. "Disabuse yourself of what you think people need," she advised the crowd, saying it was better for nonprofits to provide space and resources in communities of color than inserting themselves.
Scott-Boria, meanwhile, had been asked to grow the presence of rape-crisis services in Black communities, but she soon realized that to "create a consciousness around rape enhanced the criminalization of Black men." Furthermore, she found her task literally impossible because of the belief that funding should be spread equally throughout the state. And the conversation about rape was historically understood to be private in Black communities, although the panel agreed that approaches to that conversation are changing. Scott-Boria's granddaughter has followed in her footsteps as an anti-rape organizer, unaware that her grandmother once did the same work, and her 13-year-old grandson recently asked her to explain rape. "Boy, you asked the wrong person," Scott-Boria joked as the room exploded with laughter.
Kaba delineated the history of rape conversations in the Black community. While Black men were often accused of raping white women, which led to powerful anti-lynching activism, and Black women were often victimized by white men, the conversation about intracommunity sexual violence "didn't exist," Kaba said.
Sides recalled observing her partner in a 40hour training in which part of the agenda involved disclosing survivorhood. Initially Sides recalled wondering why the participants, all Black women, were using the training as "a therapy session." Her partner reminded Sides, no stranger to working in these worlds already, that this was an opportunity and space which Black women were rarely afforded. "Why didn't I see the beauty of what was happening there?" Sides asked, and went on to say the space probably was so effective because it was all Black and no one was offering justice, instead just the space itself.
Audience questions saw the women discussing R&B singer R. Kelly, soon to make an appearance at UlC's campus. While saying of Kelly, "that child molestor makes really good songs," Caidor critiqued Jim DeRogatis' journalism about Kelly, saying it seemed "self-interested," and recalling that on his radio show DeRogatis had once discussed Ike Turner's career without mentioning his spousal abuse."Where were you for Tina Turner?" Caidor asked rhetorically. Kaba agreed, calling the DeRogatis's pursuit of Kelly "Ahabization," and wondering on a broader level how perpetrators can repair harm.
"If there's no way back, a lot of people are going to deny they're rapists," Kaba pointed out. She continued this point in response to a question about how to restore perpetrators to communities. "We don't have a culture that encourages people to take responsibility," she said, and pointed out that we should still reward people for being accountable. Fear of punishment, Kaba continued, leads to collusion, where communities hide their wrongdoers and nothing get solved. "Communities are not going to agree to throw their people to the state," Kaba said.
Sides pointed out that artists and storytellers like R.C Riley and E. Nina Jay, who talk about their histories of sexual violence in their work, are finding ways to engage without organizing. Sides, who currently works at U of C, saw hope in a student she worked with who wanted to draft a curriculum to educate her rapist rather than go through a disciplinary process.
"People are starting to think beyond criminal justice," Sides said.
"Take Back The Fight: Resisting Sexual Violence From the Ground Up" runs through May 15 at UIC's Pop Up Just Art Gallery, 1344 S. Halsted St.

Full text: Even as technology to prevent and treat HIV infections improves, obstacles continue to impede efforts by providers and advocates to assist women living with HIV.
One such organization committed to facing those obstacles however, is Oakland, Californiabased Positive Women Network-USA (PWN-USA). Founded in 2008 by 28 women living with HIV, it now has staff in several American cities and is led by Exectutive Director Naina Khanna.
Khanna recalled that a decade ago, "Nobody was advocating on our behalf. There were huge gaps to be filled. We were also very concerned about the leadership landscape not having enough women living with HIV, particularly with very few women of color and trans women with HIV. We were born to shift that dynamic."
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 7,529 women received an HIV diagnosis in 2016; that is about 19 percent of all new infections. Women of color were disproportionately represented among those numbers: Black women represented 61 percent of the new infections; Latinx women represented 16 percent; and other groups represented five percent. White women accounted for about 19 percent of new infections.
PWN-USA fights racial and socio-economic disparities that hinder prevention and treatment strategies. According to its website, the organization "inspires, informs, and mobilizes women living with HIV to advocate for changes that improve our lives and uphold our rights. In addition to federal advocacy, PWN-USA supports regional chapters to build leadership at a local and state level."
"We build leadership in the communities most impacted by the epidemic," Khanna explained. "We advocate using a human rights and social justice framework for policies that are grounded in human rights and dignity."
Racism, poverty and lack of access to equitable healthcare are three key barriers the organization works on, she added, noting those challenges also intersect with HIV stigma.
"In the current political climate, we're sort of seeing a resurgence of sexual- and reproductivestigma, in the form of reduction of available services and the [attempts to] control what people do and not do with their bodies," she said. "This trend in political actions, policy decisions and funding mechanisms is targeting communities that are already the most marginalized for various reasons. That's a big part of what people living with HIV contend with today-[from challenges to] our reproductive futures to transgender folks being discriminated against in healthcare settings, not being able to have their types of medical care covered by insurance companies."
Khanna said the socio-political challenges have been ever-present, but the previous presidential administration had been making significant efforts to combat HIV-related issues.
"That presented a great opportunity that many cities and states started to pick up in the form of epidemic plans, and things like that," she recalled. "With the [current] administration, we're seeing a lot of threats to HIV-funding and -services and a lack of commitment. After more than a year, we don't have a director of the National Office of AIDS Policy or leadership in the administration on the domestic epidemic."
A key goal for advocates, according to Khanna, should be advancing models of trauma-informed care. "We know that 30 percent of women living with HIV, according to one study, are living with current post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We know that women living with HIV have high-rates of living with intimate partner violence and other forms of violence-and that's not even talking about structural violence that most women living with HIV are dealing with, in the form of systemic discrimination, poverty, racism and stigma."
Trauma-informed healthcare services delivery would increase engagement and retention in healthcare, so that medical care would be "a place of healing, and not just treatment," Khanna added. "We have the medications today for people to live long, healthy lives, but we can't get them to everyone. Part of that is the structural barriers like co-pays, distance to pharmacies, how hard it is to fill a prescription. But a lot of it is also about mental and emotional health and whether people have stability on their lives."
For more information, see pwn-usa.org. Khanna created a video discussing her work and experiences as part of amFAR's EPIC VOICES series to raise awareness about HIV-related issues. The video can be viewed at curecountdown.org/ epicvoices/.

Full text: ELECTIONS 2018: COOK COUNTY COURT (MCGINNIS VACANCY)
Out lawyer, adjunct professor and longtime activist Brad Trowbridge is running again for a judicial seat.
As an attorney, he has has litigated cases in domestic relations, chancery, probate and criminal divisions-and has helped protect hundreds of victims of domestic violence and their children from further abuse. As an activist, Trowbridge has been co-chair of the Chicago Metropolitan Battered Women's Network and has been on the board of directors of A New Direction BeverlyMorgan Park, among other achievements.
His Democratic primary opponents are Brian T. Sexton and Peter M. Gonzalez.
Windy City Times: This is not your first rodeo. How many times have you previously run?
Brad Trowbridge: I tried to get on the ballot in 2010, and I was unable to do that. Then I ran in 2012, and lost-so this is my third time attempting it.
WCT: And the third time's the charm. [Trowbridge laughs.] So what did you learn before from running that will help you now?
BT: It's about time management. You only have a certain amount of time in a day; most of us don't have the luxury of taking huge chunks of time off. It's about where you'll get the most signatures; after you get on the ballot, it's about how you try to reach out to large groups of people. One of the mistakes I made last time is that I'd be at an event every time-and sometimes there'd just be about 20 people there, and half the people would be judicial candidates. That's just not effective. It's about going to events like AIDS Walk or the Turkey Trot, where there are large groups of people.
Manage your time and go where the crowds are.
WCT: On the flip side, what's your biggest disadvantage in the election?
BT: It's probably not having more time to devote to the campaign. I still have to work every day, and I have clients. I don't have the luxury of giving entire days to the campaign.
WCT: You're a big advocate in many respects, especially in areas like domestic violence and civil rights. Could you talk a bit more about your advocacy background?
BT: Back in the '80s, I got a master's degree in human-development counseling, which is a lot like social work. I actually moved to Chicago to take a job at a place called the Counseling Center of Lakeview, which I think is now where Ald. [Tom] Tunney's office is located. I was a social worker who worked with older adults.
Horizons [the predecessor of Center on Halsted] rented office space from the counseling center, taking over the space at night. Then, I saw that Horizons had received funding, and it advertised for a staff member and I got that job. We wore lots of hats there; officially, my title was head of HIV/AIDS services, but I also trained volunteers, led support groups, trained people in the anti-violence program and the AIDS hotline.
After a few years, I decided I wanted to do something else. I saw people get sick and die; back then, there was no effective treatment for HIV/AIDS, and it was a big deal when AZT came out. I was burned out-a gay man in his 20s working with people who were dying, and it just took its toll on me. I learned about a counseling job at Northwestern University that involved working with LGBTQ students, so I took that.
I then decided I wanted to be more of an advocate. I then went to law school, and later worked at the Legal Assistance Foundation. The person who provided services to those suffering domestic violence had just left, and my supervisor asked if I'd be interested in this. I said, "Sure, I'll try it out"-and the rest is history. To this day, I have many clients who are victims of domestic violence.
WCT: If you win this race and become a judge, would you still be an advocate? Can a judge be an advocate?
BT: No, I don't think so. As a judge, your job is to apply the law to the facts of the case. Now that's not to say that a judge can't have a sensitivity to issues; for example, I might recognize that there's more to the story of a woman who's been battered. They might be afraid to tell the entire story because of repercussions. Having encountered so many victims and seen so many different reactions, I think I'd be able to dig a little deeper and get more insight into what's happening.
Every judge's experiences shape his or her viewpoints once they're on the bench. I couldn't be an advocate, but I think I could be sensitive to issues.
WCT: So you're 100-percent sure it wouldn't affect your objectivity?
BT: That's a good question. I don't think [my objectivity would be affected], and I'll tell you why: I've had cases in which I represented men who I strongly believed were falsely accused of domestic violence. I feel very frustrated if I feel a false claim has been brought, because I feel that harms the true victims.
WCT: Why do you believe there should be more LGBT judges?
BT: I think we're underrepresented, to start with; I think there are only six openly gay male judges out of 420 or 430 in Cook County. I don't think sexual orientation is the issue-it's the perspective. That's why we need more diversity on the bench from different life experiences.
I also think the more diverse the judiciary, the more educated the judiciary will be. If judges interact with each other, they'll learn more about each other's community-and that extends to training. When you encounter someone, and like and respect that person, you're more likely to change your opinion or ask more open questions. Being an LGBT judge or candidate gives us the opportunity to educate the judiciary in a way that wouldn't otherwise be available.
WCT: What's one thing about you that our readers might find surprising?
BT: I didn't go to law school until I was 37. My previous career was completely different from law-although in ways, it's not-in terms of the work I did. But I don't know of any other judge who has a master's degree in social work. I know some who've been CPAs or have had other careers as a background.
WCT: And your previous career would help you as a judge?
BT: I can't imagine that it would hurt. As I told a friend of mine, I've learned to be a very good listener-even if they tell a slightly different version than something they've previously said. Some people might say, "Oh, he's been a counselor; that'll give him more sensitivity to people who've struggled emotionally." But I'd also say it's made me a better listener; that's what has also made me a better attorney.

Abstract: (Furnishings include window benches for playgoers of stationary bent, but since the intrigue will be spread over the entire landscape, couples may want to part.) The occasion is the 40th birthday of Mrs. Suzanne Wellington, the hosts are in-laws Ellie and Beau, attended by the guest-of-honor's husband Jackson, local politician Charles and wife Lauren, trustfund playboy Tucker and current consort Cassie (who, as a shocked matron gasps, "looks like Lena Horne"). Before the cake appears, we will bear witness to hints of past crimes, some linked to their time and place (out-of-wedlock pregnancy, marijuana consumption), some still evident today (embezzlement, adultery, domestic abuse).

Full text: THEATER REVIEW
Southern Gothic
Playwright: Leslie Liautaud
At: Windy City Playhouse, 3014 W. Irving Park Rd.
Tickets: $65-$85
Runs through: March 18
In some circles, this literary genre would be called "immersive" theater, in others, "fly-onthe-wall" drama. The important thing to remember is that flies don't always remain in the same spot on the same wall.
As in Alan Aykbourn's House & Garden, Leslie Liautaud's play progresses in simultaneous real time over several locales, and as in "mosh pit" staging, audience members are free to roam the performance space at will. Unlike promenade staging, however, they are not ushered in groups, nor do they interact with the characters-this isn't Tony and Tina's Wedding. Once the action commences, spectators are to eavesdrop, but not interrupt.
Our setting on this summer day in 1961 is a post-bellum house in Ashford, Georgia-parlor, dining room, kitchen, bathroom, patio and front stoop, replicated both inside and outside with dioramic accuracy, down to the civic-booster jingles on the radio. (Furnishings include window benches for playgoers of stationary bent, but since the intrigue will be spread over the entire landscape, couples may want to part.) The occasion is the 40th birthday of Mrs. Suzanne Wellington, the hosts are in-laws Ellie and Beau, attended by the guest-of-honor's husband Jackson, local politician Charles and wife Lauren, trustfund playboy Tucker and current consort Cassie (who, as a shocked matron gasps, "looks like Lena Horne").
The dubious legality of interracial dating in 1961 isn't the only socially divisive issue that will ensue-conflicts fueled by the delayed arrival of catered refreshments mandating a repast based in pantry staples and a surplus of alcohol. Before the cake appears, we will bear witness to hints of past crimes, some linked to their time and place (out-of-wedlock pregnancy, marijuana consumption), some still evident today (embezzlement, adultery, domestic abuse). Which of these topics will be explored in greatest detail depends on where you happen to be during discussion thereof-you know, the same as at a reallife party.
Ninety minutes of continuous activity involving this many moving parts-did I mention the backyard fistfight?-could dissolve into chaos faster than a soggy spam-and-saltine canape. Fortunately, this Windy City Playhouse production has at its helm David H. Bell, the unsurpassed master of three-ring spectacles. He is assisted by an eight-member ensemble who navigate its confined quarters with drill-team precision to ensure everyone gets his or her just deserts in the end.

Abstract: Because of maltreatment in jail, in 2014 James become a delegate to testify before the Committee Against Torture (CAT) at Geneva Switzerland. The over-policing of women of color is due to gang violence, the war on drugs, war on terrorism, Islamophobia, poverty, sex trade, domestic violence and mental health, to name a few. According to a 2016 investigation by the Buffalo News, a police officer, on average, is caught in the act of sexual misconduct every five days.

Full text: The reality of unarmed African-American women- LBTQ, gender nonconforming and straight-being beaten, profiled, sexually violated and murdered by law enforcement officials with alarming regularity is too often ignored, especially with the focus of police brutality on our males.
Like so many African-American women, Sandra Bland's death in 2015, resulting from police brutality was not new news. The national attention it received was, however.
Recently, Northeastern University conducted a panel to discuss the topic titled "Invisible No More: Black Women and Police Violence" that looked at criminalization of African-American women, Indigenous women, and women of color like Two-Spirit, Latinx, Asian, Arab and Middle Eastern women, to name a few, and mass incarceration and police violence that sometimes resulted with deadly consequences.
The panel of experts included:
-Andrea Ritchie is an African-American lesbian and a police misconduct attorney and organizer. She's the author of Invisible No More: Racial Profiling and Police Brutality Against Women of Color that has recently come out, and the co-author of Say Her Name: Resisting Police Violence Against Black Women as well as Queer (In)Justice: The Criminalization of LGBT People in the United States.
-Simone John is a Boston-based poet, educator and facilitator. She's the author of Testify, her first full-length book of poems about African-Americans impacted by state-sanctioned violence.
-Monica James is a Black trans woman activist. She is the national organizer for Black and Pink, and a collective member of Transformative Justice Law Project. Because of maltreatment in jail, in 2014 James become a delegate to testify before the Committee Against Torture (CAT) at Geneva Switzerland. Her work towards the advancement of trans justice, transformative justice, and prison abolition has made her national spokeswoman.
Robyn Maynard is a Black feminist author, grassroots community organizer and independent scholar based in Montreal. She's the author of Policing Black Lives: State Violence in Canada from Slavery to the Present.
The panel discussed the context around the historical and present-day patterns and paradigms of policing and punishment that stems from centuries of colonialism, slavery, segregation, and immigration. The over-policing of women of color is due to gang violence, the war on drugs, war on terrorism, Islamophobia, poverty, sex trade, domestic violence and mental health, to name a few.
Transmisogyny and racism put transgender women of color, in particular, at a high risk of police violence. Less than half of trans women of color report discriminatory policing such as "stop and frisk" and "walking while trans." Trans women of color who have participated in underground economies have experienced excessive police violence-i.e., 34 percent of Latinx and 53 percent of Blacks.
For example, in 2007 James was subjected to excessive police violence. She was viciously attacked by an off-duty police officer in Chicago, arrested, and charged with attempted murder for defending herself. While in prison, James, like many trans women, was misgendered by correctional officers and inmates, sexually assaulted repeatedly and denied access to gender-affirming healthcare.
Shockingly, too, gender-based forms of police violence, such as sexual assault, are wildly pervasive, gravely ignored and deliberately underreported. While the nation learned of the rapes of more than a dozen African-American women at the hand of now-convicted Oklahoma City police officer Daniel Holtzclaw, most incidents like this one enjoy impunity.
The reason many sexual assaults go unaccounted for is that half of the 35 top 50 police departments in the United States have no policies prohibiting police sexual violence against the public. According to a 2016 investigation by the Buffalo News, a police officer, on average, is caught in the act of sexual misconduct every five days. Ritchie stated, "Those are just the ones who are caught, representing, by all accounts, just the tip of the iceberg of this pervasive yet invisible form of police violence."
For example, to avoid being assaulted during "stop-and-frisk" many women of color have been forced into sexual acts to stave off arrest. Too often an officer will "turn off the microphone on his body camera and later claim it malfunctioned, and then lie about the gender of drivers he pulled over to cover up the numbers of women he targeted," Ritchie stated.
Bland has come "to stand for every Black woman who has ever changed lanes without using a turn signal or expressed frustration at getting a traffic ticket."
However, the perceptions and stereotypes of African-American women-combative, mouthy, not deferential enough and "angry Black woman"-can sadly turn into deadly action as we see with Bland. Bland's crime is what's depicted as "contempt of cop." She wasn't obsequious or subservient enough when the officer asked her to extinguish her cigarette. And for something as minor as a traffic signal violation, the incident escalated out of control. But when the dominant culture doesn't see and hear African-American voices about our pains, fears, vulnerabilities our humanity is distorted and made invisible through a prism of racist and sexist stereotypes. So, too, is our suffering.
The campaign "Say Her Name" addresses the lack of reporting, documenting, and accounting for the violations and death of African-American women and girls at the hand of law enforcement officials.
Every day when my spouse or I leave home, I pray we return to each other.

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/ncavp-hrc-tpocc-release-reports-on-anti-trans/docview/1968383516/se-2?accountid=14696

Abstract: The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) has released the report "Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and HIV-Affected Intimate Partner Violence in 2016." (Chicago's Center on Halsted was the Illinois representative.) Among the results are: -LGBTQ and HIV-affected people of color made up 60 percent of the reports of IPV homicides, and 59 percent of the total number of survivors who reported to NCAVP members in 2016; -Transgender women were 2.5 times more likely to be stalked, 2.5 times more likely to experience financial violence, and twice as likely to experience online harassment within IPV; and -There was an increase in the percentage of survivors who identified as Latinx from 24 percent in 2015 to 30 percent in 2016. [...]the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation and the Trans People of Color Coalition (TPOCC) have released "A Time to Act: Fatal Violence Against Transgender People in America in 2017." Since the start of the year, at least 25 transgender people have been killed in the United States-the most on record.

Full text: The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) has released the report "Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and HIV-Affected Intimate Partner Violence in 2016."
The report looks at the experiences of 2,032 survivors of intimate-partner violence (IPV) who reported to 14 NCAVP member organizations from nine states, including California, Texas, New York, Arizona, Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, Vermont and Missouri. (Chicago's Center on Halsted was the Illinois representative.)
Among the results are:
-LGBTQ and HIV-affected people of color made up 60 percent of the reports of IPV homicides, and 59 percent of the total number of survivors who reported to NCAVP members in 2016;
-Transgender women were 2.5 times more likely to be stalked, 2.5 times more likely to experience financial violence, and twice as likely to experience online harassment within IPV; and
-There was an increase in the percentage of survivors who identified as Latinx from 24 percent in 2015 to 30 percent in 2016.
Also, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation and the Trans People of Color Coalition (TPOCC) have released "A Time to Act: Fatal Violence Against Transgender People in America in 2017."
Since the start of the year, at least 25 transgender people have been killed in the United States-the most on record. Eighty-four percent were people of color, and 80 percent were women.
This report lists those transgender individuals who have been killed so far in 2017, complete with photos and bios. There is then information about cases of fatal violence by race, gender identity and state, among other classifications. (Illinois, for example, has three cases of fatal violence between 2013-17; California and Louisiana were tied for the most, with 10 each.)
In a statement, Center on Halsted Chief Program Officer Dr. Hector Torres said, "As a founding member of NCAVP, Center on Halsted has been providing services to support LGBTQ survivors of domestic and sexual violence since 1988, while contributing to shifting policy and practice efforts to be more LGBTQ-inclusive, nationally."
"Not only are these individuals more likely to be targeted; their options for accessing safe and relevant services diminishes. This is a big reason why LGBTQ specific services are crucial to our communities," added Rachel Tillman, AVP cinical advocate at Center on Halsted.
In Chicago, the majority (57 percent) domestic and sexual violence reported to Center on Halsted's Anti-Violence Program , were made by those who identified as cisgender males. People of color accounted for 63 percent of known ethnicity (29 percent African American, 26 percent Latinx, 3 percent Arab/Middle Eastern, and 5 percent Asian). Of those who reported their sexuality, the majority identified as gay (49 percent) with lesbians (18 percent) making up the next largest category. Transgender survivors face particular vulnerabilities, for instance, reporting additional violence when reporting the abuse to police.

Abstract: [...]he also experienced some negative feedback, including from those within the LGTQ community, who questioned the validity of his orientation-and of bisexuality in general. People talk about how fake it is, and also about the supposed rampant use of steroids, pointing to people like Chris Benoit [a wrestler who used illegal steroids, and who killed his wife and son before commiting suicide in 2007]. [...]there's a strict policy-and the guys don't even go out anymore; they tend to play video games.

Full text: Earlier this year, professional wrestler Anthony Bowens made waves and amassed support when he came out as bisexual.
However, he also experienced some negative feedback, including from those within the LGTQ community, who questioned the validity of his orientation-and of bisexuality in general.
Bowens (who said he's "still getting used to everything") recently talked with Windy City Times about his sport (including stereotypes), coming out and the stigma he faced after doing so.
Windy City Times: I want to start talking about the sport itself. I go back to the days of [former pro wrestlers] Harley Race, Nick Bockwinkel, Wahoo McDaniel and others. I'm curious as to how you even got involved in wrestling.
Anthony Bowens: Well, I was a big fan, too. I didn't know if I could do it, because most people don't realize how you can become a wrestler in the first place. Back in those days of Bockwinkel, Race and [Ric] Flair, business was a lot more protected. You had to have a connection to get in, and then you really had to pay your dues to be accepted. Nowadays, you can just join a wrestling school, which I found out after my college days.
I played baseball for 11 years. I stopped playing due to injury and I was kind of losing my mind; I was used to being on a baseball field for five or six hours a day. All of a sudden, it was gone-and I didn't know what to do with myself. Long story short, I started to look into wrestling. I happened to be lifting at my gym (and the WWE was in town) and a wrestler was there; I bothered him, asking for a picture. He then stopped me and a buddy, and asked me if I ever thought about being a wrestler. I went to the Creative Pro Wrestling Academy and, a week later, I started training.
WCT: Who was your main inspiration?
AB: Looking back, Sting was the main one who got me into it. Jeff Hardy inspired me as a person; he's always fearless and jumping off ladders. I was a shy young man, and he got me to be myself. I also got to appreciate wrestlers such as Chris Jericho and Eddie Guerrero-guys like that.
WCT: What do you think is the biggest misconception about pro wrestling? People talk about how fake it is, and also about the supposed rampant use of steroids, pointing to people like Chris Benoit [a wrestler who used illegal steroids, and who killed his wife and son before commiting suicide in 2007].
AB: To be honest, it's both of those. I hate the F-word [laughs]; I prefer the word "scripted." It's certainly not fake when I wake up the next morning and I feel like I've been hit by a truck. You have to look at it as scripted entertainment. The ring is not a trampoline; there's maybe an inch of padding, if it's a good one. It's a very physical sport.
Everything hurts-but we do it in ways that we don't get injured, if that makes sense. I've even had my tooth go through my bottom lip from a dropkick, and I've [severely] hurt nerves in my back; I've also gotten concussions. You usually walk away with something after each match.
There's also a misconception about the lifestyle. The lifestyle was way different in the '80s and '90s than it is now. Steroids and drugs were rampant, and combining those with being in the ring could be bad news. Now, there's a strict policy-and the guys don't even go out anymore; they tend to play video games. We're definitely moving forward in a better way.
WCT: With the injuries you've suffered, are you concerned with how you're going to be when you're, say, 50? [Bowens is 26.]
AB: Um ... that thought crosses my mind sometime, but I try to live in the present a little bit. I try not to let it deter me, though. Also, everyone's body is different; one wrestler can wrestle for a year and get injuries that last a lifetime, while others-like Jeff Hardy, who's been flipping off ladders for 15 to 20 years-can wrestle forever.
WCT: You made news earlier this year with Outsports. It's interesting: You came out as bisexual and got some blowback, including from those in the LGBT community. What's your response to someone who thinks, for example, that you're gay and not ready to admit it?
AB: Like I've said before, it's LGBTQ before for a reason. [Critics] have no right to say what a person should define themselves as; that's that person's choice. I know plenty of people who define themselves as bisexual; some prefer men over women, others like women more than men and some don't care. Yes, bisexuality exists.
If you have an attraction to both genders, you have, for example, an attraction to men that doesn't go away-even if you marry a woman for the rest of your life. I don't think people really understand that. It's not right for someone to tell others how they should identify themselves.
WCT: I don't know if you saw [Green Bay Packers quarterback] Aaron Rodgers when he said [on ESPN.com] that gay NFL players are still afraid of losing their jobs.
AB: Oh, I didn't see that.
WCT: OK. Well, I'm wondering if the wrestling community was very supportive when you came out.
AB: Oh, yes-and it was such a big relief. Wrestling was the reason why I hadn't come out a lot earlier. I'm not blaming wrestling-I had this fear of the unknown, and I was putting pressure on myself. I was very happy and relieved that nobody cared. Plus, I'm well-liked, so it made my friendships stronger because I wasn't hiding anything.
WCT: Are you comfortable with the label "role model?"
AB: Yes. When I sit down and think about it, it's crazy. I just want to affect someone's life positively because I've had people help me, whether directly or indirectly, with issues that were sports-related or personal. I never thought I'd help people on this grand level-especially after I first came out and I got all these messages from all over the world.
WCT: And it's not just the support where you felt relief in coming out. It was also in the act itself, right?
AB: Oh, yeah. I was tired of dodging conversations, and I was dating Michael [Pavano], who is an absolutely amazing person. It was unfair to him once we entered that relationship. I told him I wouldn't be in the closet forever, but I had to censor certain things-like I couldn't put photos of us together on social media. I know it killed him, but he cared about me enough to go through that time period. You should never ask someone to have a relationship under those circumstances, but I give him a ton of credit for sticking with me.
WCT: My last question has nothing to do with sexuality. [Bowens laughs.] Pro wrestler Nikki Bella is competing on Dancing with the Stars. Would you ever try that if asked?
AB: That's interesting, because I was asked that the other day. I am a horrible dancer! [Laughs] I have zero rhythm-but I would try it. It'd be ugly for the first week or two, though. [Laughs] However, I am a quick study.

Judge Nancy Katz reflects on career

Abstract: Judge Nancy Katz-recently retired from the Cook County Circuit Court and the first openly lesbian judge there-said that judges have an important role to play in bringing about social change. Among her community-service accomplishments were posts on the board of the Lesbian and Gay Bar Association of Chicago, the former Chicago Commission on Human Relations' Advisory Council on Gay and Lesbian Issues, and Cook County Hospital's Women and Children with AIDS Project advisory board. In June 2017, she was awarded the Community Leadership Award by Illinois State Bar Association's standing committee on sexual orientation and gender identity.

Full text: Judge Nancy Katz-recently retired from the Cook County Circuit Court and the first openly lesbian judge there-said that judges have an important role to play in bringing about social change.
"You certainly advance justice on a case-bycase approach, by making good, impartial decisions based on the law, facts and a compassionate approach to people," she explained. "One-by-one-by one, [judges] make a difference. But there are systemic issues in the law: how people access justice; how they interact with the court system; how they are listened to; and how interpreters are provided. Those affect people's access to justice."
Katz has had a storied career as an activist, lawyer and judge, with accomplishments not only in the realm of family-law, her professional specialty, but in LGBT-rights as well. Among her community-service accomplishments were posts on the board of the Lesbian and Gay Bar Association of Chicago, the former Chicago Commission on Human Relations' Advisory Council on Gay and Lesbian Issues, and Cook County Hospital's Women and Children with AIDS Project advisory board. In June 2017, she was awarded the Community Leadership Award by Illinois State Bar Association's standing committee on sexual orientation and gender identity. Katz was named to the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame-now the Chicago LGBT Hall of Fame-in 2000.
Though she stepped down from the bench, where she presided in the Cook County Circuit Court's domestic relations division, in July, Katz has shifted gears only slightly. She has gone to work for the JAMS Foundation, a nationwide organization providing mediation and arbitration services. She specializes in family-law cases.
"I've been really enjoying that," she said. "It's been a lot of fun to build a business that is so people-oriented."
Katz said that her background as a feminist and an activist really influenced her decision to focus on family law issues. "I saw the need for services for women who have been subjected to domestic violence," she added. "... In my teenage years and early-20s, we did a lot of work on domestic violence, such as Take Back the Night [marches]. I worked with some people that started one of the first domestic-violence shelters for women and [another] woman who had a domestic-violence legal clinic. It was kind of natural that I would gravitate to that area as I became a lawyer and as a judge, where I ended up in the domestic relations division, [and] where we dealt with all kinds of issues."
She credits colleagues-especially Judge Sebastian Patti and former Judge Tom Chiola, the first openly gay men on the Cook County bench- with "being a wonderful source of support" while she was a judge.
"I was surprised at how collegial [most of] the judges were," she recalled. "They were very welcoming-much more than I expected. I knew that being out was a very important thing. For them, it 'normalized' gay people in a way that they hadn't experienced before. They were very receptive to the message, and very open. The task was not as hard as it could have been. From the top down, there was a very concerted effort to be a very diverse and welcoming bench."
When Katz began her work on the bench in 1999, she was assigned to a marriage court. She told a colleague how ironic it was that she had the power to join people in matrimony, but could not, at the time, be legally married herself. Her colleagues "all looked at me, with their eyes wide open. One of them said, 'Do you want me to take your shift?' I think it opened their eyes."
There are now multiple openly LGBT judges, Katz noted. "It has really come a long way. [The judiciary] went from being 'out in the wilderness' to being a good home for LGBTQ lawyers."
She won't miss the sense of separation that comes from being a judge, however.
"You can't do some of the activist work that you did previously, because of the ethics rules that govern judges," Katz explained. "There's a certain amount of isolation that goes with the territory. ... I'm not complaining, because there's other benefits that go along with it. Chief among them is, you get to go to work every day and do justice. There's nothing like it."

Legal specialist talks about aspects of criminal-justice system

Author: Tanaschuk, Emagin

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/legal-specialist-talks-about-aspects-criminal/docview/1939705727/se-2?accountid=14696

Abstract: Throughout college I volunteered at different sexual assault, domestic violence and immigration agencies. [...]much-about two thirds of my current case load is around domestic-violence and sexual-assault cases, and the other third is everything else. There is also a huge need for domesticiolence and sexual-assault support in the queer community because stigmas and fear make these topics unspeakable, when in fact, these issues are just as prevalent among LGBT people.

Full text: Angelica D'Souza (a Windy City Times 30 Under 30 honoree this year) is the only LGBT and hatecrime victim witness specialist at the Cook County state's attorney's office.
She works with LGBT individuals as well as other people who are affected by hate crimes. She often accompanies victims to court hearings, provides resources for them, and serves as a support system.
Windy City Times: What led you to this career?
Angelica D'Souza: Actually, my educational background was not very related to social science; rather, it was more humanities-based. But something that always interested me was genderbased violence work. Throughout college I volunteered at different sexual assault, domestic violence and immigration agencies. I was drawn to the acute immediate support that folks need after an incident, and also the prevention piece.
WCT: Is there any overlap between the domestic violence work you have done previously and the work you are involved in now?
AD: So much-about two thirds of my current case load is around domestic-violence and sexual-assault cases, and the other third is everything else. There is also a huge need for domesticiolence and sexual-assault support in the queer community because stigmas and fear make these topics unspeakable, when in fact, these issues are just as prevalent among LGBT people. But more generally speaking, domestic violence plagues so many other communities as well, because of the stigma surrounding it.
People still think of it is an "at home" problem and if you are already fighting discrimination, there can be worry about what happens to a demographic's credibility if word gets out about certain crimes.
WCT: What is most challenging about your job?
AD: I will start with the challenging: I am not good with confrontation or conflict, but sometimes it is required, and when you are dealing with trauma, it is important to not be afraid to sit in conflict in order to keep people safe emotionally and physically. The other challenge is that it can be hard to see past the concentration of negativity and negative situations that we deal with each day. But I try to remember how vibrant this city and county really is despite some negative situations.
WCT: What about it comes easy?
AD: It is going to sound really corny, but sitting with someone and holding their shit with them-helping them hold what is hurting them. I think I am lucky enough to be someone who has a lot of emotional space to help people and have compassion for them, so that part is never hard.
WCT: What about your job is rewarding?
AD: Helping somebody find justice is rewarding. Now, don't get me wrong, most people do not find justice in the criminal justice system, but it can happen in lots of other ways. Bearing witness to people find their own justice in however it happens is the reason I do what I do.
WCT: How can the legal system change to better support LGBT individuals?
AD: Our criminal justice system rarely addresses the root of a problem. For example, prosecuting young queer kids because they're housing insecure and are doing what they need to do to get by is not justice. Recognizing that certain crimes are crimes of poverty is a good step. Sentencing someone to a felony for stealing something when they are trying to get by isn't helping anybody.
WCT: What does the future hold for you?
AD: I would eventually like to do more community engagement and education work that I am doing now. I want to keep making the system that we have work better and address the needs that my community has.
WCT: Are there any striking issues with the way the Cook County justice system operates in regards to minority groups?
AD: The system fundamentally is not a recognition of humanity-it's not designed that way. In criminal law, it's the state versus a person. It is an inherently dehumanizing process for everyone involved.
WCT: How does it dehumanize victims?
AD: Something as basic as referring to someone by the wrong pronouns boils down to not seeing someone's humanity. You shouldn't have to fight to be treated like a person.

His coming-out story was published by BuzzFeed, CNN, NPR, Windy City Times and other media outlets in order to highlight the issue of treatment of the LGBT community in Russia and Chechnya.
Did you know? Due to an anti-gay propaganda law, Artem's coming-out video put him at risk of arrest if he returns to Russia.

Abstract: On Jun 12, the National Coalition of Anti Violence Programs (NCAVP) published its 2016 report. According to data collected nationwide throughout the coalition's 12 member programs, 2016 was the deadliest year on record for the LGBTQ Community. The report noted a 17% increase in homicides of LGBTQ people, not including the lives taken during the Pulse nightclub shooting. The NCAVP reported a total of 77 hate violence- related homicides of LGBTQ and HIV-affected people in 2016.

Full text: While the festivals, parades and appearance of Rainbow flags in cities across the world are traditions designed to celebrate Pride month, since 1997 the National Coalition of Anti Violence Programs (NCAVP) release of its National Report on Hate Violence Against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and HIV-Affected Communities has served as a sober reminder of the need to lift-up and humanize LGBTQ individuals yearround.
On June 12, the NCAVP published its 2016 report.
According to data collected nationwide throughout the coalition's 12 member programs, 2016 was "the deadliest year on record for the LGBTQ Community."
The report noted a "17 [percent] increase in homicides of LGBTQ people, not including the lives taken during the Pulse nightclub shooting."
June 12 also marked the one year anniversary of the massacre and ceremonies were held across the nation to remember the 49 souls who were ripped from their families and friends in a vicious act of hatred.
The NCAVP reported a total of 77 "hate violence-related homicides of LGBTQ and HIV-affected people in 2016."
It noted that 79 percent of those individuals were people of color, 68 percent were transgender and gender nonconforming people, 61 percent marked both the numbers of transgender women of color who were murdered that year and people under the age of 35.
The NCAVP also stated that it "received information on 1,036 incidents of hate violence across the country. The majority of survivors identified as gay, were below the age of 39, or were people of color."
The types of hate violence experienced included verbal harassment, threats or intimidation (all of which ranked as the most prevalent), physical violence, online or mobile harassment, discrimination and bullying.
Most of those people who reported an act of violence against them (58 percent) knew their attacker. The NCAVP went on to note that, of those people who reported an act of violence against them to law enforcement, "of those who interacted with police, 35 [percent] of survivors said that the police were indifferent and 31 [percent] said that the police were hostile."
In Illinois, the Center on Halsted stated that, in 2016, the organization "interfaced with 58 persons calling to report incidences of violence."
The Center added that the majority of those calls (78 percent) were intimate partner/domestic violence related while 22 percent were hate violence reports.
Lisa Gilmore is the principal and founder of the Illinois Accountability Initiative which is also a member program of the NCAVP. She also sits on the NCAVP's governance and policy committees.
"We have seen a cultural backlash against the gains made by the LGBTQ community in terms of civil rights," Gilmore told Windy City Times. "That backlash has occurred in policy in legislation across the United States. Bathroom bills and religious freedom acts are intentionally meant to push back against equality."
She added that, in the same way legislators have been using policy as a form of attack, "there are other people who use hate violence to show their opposition to LGBTQ equality and liberation. We have historically seen an increase in anti-LGBTQ violence during national campaigns for LGBTQ rights and obviously, during this past election cycle, we saw a lot of explicit rejection of people who are different."
In 2016, Windy City Times completed an extensive report into the correlation between an increase in anti-transgender propaganda and the violence against transgender and gender nonconforming individuals. Gilmore agrees that there is a link between hate crimes and anti-LGBTQ discourse in politics and the media.
The NCAVP's report from that year stated that "following the election, there was an increase in hate violence targeting LGBTQ people, Muslim communities, immigrant communities and communities of color. These communities were fearful that the Trump Administration and conservative legislators across the country would actively work to roll back the few protections they had, and that the hateful rhetoric used to support conservative policies would incite further acts of hate violence. Sadly, the actions taken by the federal administration, from discriminatory Executive Orders to the appointment of Jeff Sessions, Betsy Devos, and others, show that these fears were not unfounded."
"When you look at what is behind people who commit hate crimes, what you see is that the people who are perpetrating these crimes believe that they are trying to send a message about upholding social norms," Gilmore said. "When there are messages of otherness, rejection or people singled out as the root cause of the problems of others, it becomes much easier to perpetrate violence against these folks."
In terms of solutions and to mark the tenth anniversary of its work tracking hate violence nationwide, the NCVAP has released a platform designed to "end violence against LGBTQ communities."
The platform's calls to action include a recognition of "historical systems of oppression such as white supremacy and anti-Black racism, patriarchy and colonialism as root causes of violence."
It stresses the need to "support communitybased efforts that create pathways for individual and community healing" along with advocacy for "education, healthcare, housing and economic opportunities that affirm the experiences of transgender and gender nonconforming people of color."
Echoing an exponentially growing nationwide resistance movement, the NCAVP reasserted the need to "call out and resist 'religious exemption' and 'public accommodation' bills for the hateful legislation that they are" and to "act in solidarity with all movements working towards liberation and self-determination of people impacted by oppression and violence."
Gilmore added a need for messaging that celebrates the humanity of LGBTQ individuals.
"It's a lot harder for people to see someone as an object that they can do violence to when they see them as a fully human, worthy of respect who adds to the beauty of communities," she said. "Being the recipients of hate through culture does not define who we are."

Full text: A youth resident of a Sheridan Park housing facility owned by Chicago House was brutally beaten and stabbed to death in the evening hours of June 11 according to multiple news reports.
Unconfirmed reports state that 12-year-old Alexis Stubbs was the victim of a domestic assault. On June 12, the Chicago Police Department (CPD) announced that a Chicago man John Singleton had been charged with first degree murder in Stubbs' death.
According to the Chicago Tribune, Singleton is an ex-boyfriend of the girl's mother. Prison records show that Singleton had just served a three-year sentence at Menard Correctional Center for aggravated domestic battery/strangulation.
The attack against Stubbs allegedly occurred following a 911 call made by the mother after the suspect refused to leave the apartment.
Chicago House Chief Executive Officer Scott Ammarell told Windy City Times that staff and residents of the housing facility are "devastated."
"It's a tight-knit group of people," he said.
"Our first priority is to cooperate with the police as they conduct their investigation," he added "Our other is to make sure that the other residents in the building have the support and services they need. That goes as well for our staff. We are helping people deal with this situation."
Ammarell emphasized that Chicago House takes security at all its facilities very seriously.
"Obviously, there is nothing that's fool proof," he said. "Once the investigation is completed, we will review our security to see if there are changes that need to be made. We are continuing to make sure that the building is as safe as we can make it."
"This is a tragedy for the entire agency," he added. "We all work every day on behalf of our clients and this is something that is just unimaginable and we're all deeply impacted by it."

Patrick Dati raises voice against domestic abuse

Author: Dewey, Charlsie

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/patrick-dati-raises-voice-against-domestic-abuse/docview/1906866770/se-2?accountid=14696

Abstract: Dati said the assault also led to more abusive situations, including the one with his first male partner. In 2014, he wrote his memoir, I Am Me, detailing the abuse he endured and its impacts and he began doing public speaking engagements to talk about his experiences. Dati, who lives in Chicago, regularly speaks to youth at the Center on Halstead and has previously led discussions with the Chicago Police Department on intimate partner violence and how it uniquely impacts men and LGBT victims. Denise Brown, eldest sister of the late Nicole Brown Simpson, formed The Elite Speakers Bureau in 2010 to bring awareness and provide education on domestic violence, school safety, child abuse, teen violence, elder abuse, stalking, net crimes, workplace violence, victims of crime, sexual assault, mental health & wellness and more. Dati is also working on a second book, which he said is focused on the impacts of intimate partner violence and domestic violence on mental health.

Full text: After coming out, Patrick Dati fell for a man who seemed great at first, but later began physically abusing him.
The abuse went on for a long time, reaching its peak one night when Dati said his partner threw him down a flight of stairs, sending him to the hospital with a broken arm.
Dati said by this point everyone was already aware of the abuse. His friends had encouraged him to get out of the relationship and many had abandoned him because they couldn't stand to watch him stay with his abuser.
That night was his turning point, but Dati said it wasn't easy and for most men and LGBT victims of intimate partner violence, getting out can be especially challenging and dangerous.
"When I speak at the Center on Halsted now and I speak to the youth, most are young, they meet older men or women who are successful and they move in with them. They've been deserted from their families and if they leave they have nowhere to go.
"That is the problem in regard to the LGBT community with domestic violence. It typically is the younger youth who draw to someone that they think can help them and they fall in love with them and that person is supportive financially and then that person becomes abusive and then they don't know how to get out and escape. It sounds really easy, they can walk out the door, but where will you go if you don't have the financial ability?"
Dati said in his situation he was able to move in with his parents for a while to escape his abuser and later sought help at Center on Halstead.
"I was living with him at that point and I needed to leave that situation," he said. "I waited until he leftand we removed all my items from his house and I moved back to my parents' house and he began stalking me. He came to my parent's house. I had a restraining order against him and my friends all knew it. He haunted me for several months. It was very difficult."
The situation wasn't Dati's first experience with violence. As a nine year old, he became the victim of serial killer and rapist John Wayne Gacy, who he said raped him in a public restroom.
That traumatic event had sent his life into a tailspin.
"After I was raped, I changed as an individual," he said.
He said he fell into a deep depression, flunked the third grade and began distancing himself from others.
"I kind of became this sheltered kid," he said. Dati said the assault also led to more abusive situations, including the one with his first male partner.
"People who have been abused are drawn to abusive people, but in my situation I was drawn to people that were good to me in the beginning and then it turned abusive," he said. "I felt I needed to help them and that I could help them, to stop them from abusing others."
Today, Dati is determined to use his experiences to help others. He said male victims are often forgotten about and he hopes to change that.
In 2014, he wrote his memoir, I Am Me, detailing the abuse he endured and its impacts and he began doing public speaking engagements to talk about his experiences.
Dati, who lives in Chicago, regularly speaks to youth at the Center on Halstead and has previously led discussions with the Chicago Police Department on intimate partner violence and how it uniquely impacts men and LGBT victims.
"It's public knowledge 80 to 85 percent of men don't come forward about their abuse out of fear and shame," Dati said. "It's no different in the LGBT community."
Recently, Dati was asked to join the Elite Speakers Bureau as its first gay male survivor of domestic abuse. He will speak to audiences nationwide about intimate partner violence affecting gay and straight men and the LGBTQ community.
Denise Brown, eldest sister of the late Nicole Brown Simpson, formed The Elite Speakers Bureau in 2010 to bring awareness and provide education on domestic violence, school safety, child abuse, teen violence, elder abuse, stalking, net crimes, workplace violence, victims of crime, sexual assault, mental health & wellness and more.
"I am so grateful to Denise Brown for giving me this platform to amplify the often invisible issue of domestic abuse impacting gay men, straight men and members of the LGBTQ community," Dati said.
Dati was also elected earlier this year to the board of directors for the Break the Silence Foundation, a domestic violence non-profit. He is serving as chairman of the planning committee.
Dati is also working on a second book, which he said is focused on the impacts of intimate partner violence and domestic violence on mental health.
"A lot of times folks think that goes away with therapy or medication," he said. "People believe you are cured and you are not. I learned that firsthand when my first book came out and I was on a book tour, doing radio, TV, etcetera. I thought 'I'm making a difference and doing something great for the world,' but then it slipped away and part of the reason is I stopped seeing my psychiatrist and taking my meds, and that happens to a lot of individuals."
Dati said his message to others is pretty simple, "You need to get out of that situation because it isn't going to change."
He added, "For me, it was a cycle of abuse. I didn't want to live that way anymore and I wanted to be a happy person and I wanted to be secure. There is hope and you don't need to live with abuse. Sometimes it is difficult to walk away, but at the same time by walking away you get back your sense of security."
He also encourages individuals experiencing abuse or who have leftabusive situations to get professional help in dealing with the trauma.
"Most importantly is psychological therapy," he said. "Without that it's not going to change."
Dati and Brown will speak at Break the Silence Foundation's annual gala on Friday, Oct. 27, at the Donald E. Stephens Convention Center, 5555 Rosemont Rd., in Rosemont, Illinois.

LGBTQ partner violence presents unique challenges

Abstract: [...]more than 43 percent of lesbian women and 26 percent of gay men in the U.S. have experienced some type of physical intimate partner violence, or IPV, according to sources cited in Dr. Adam Messinger's new book, LGBTQ Intimate Partner Violence: Lessons for Policy, Practice, and Research, published by the University of California Press. [...]a substantial amount of research has shown that people who are not yet out of the closet about their sexual orientation or their trans* identity to everyone in their lives-and frankly most people aren't out to everyone- leaves them vulnerable to abusers who might use that as leverage to say, 'if you tell anyone about what I'm doing to you or if you leave me, I can out you to your parents, your siblings, to your employer, your friends,'" Messinger said.

In new book, Chicago author dispels myths and finds intimate partner violence is more prevalent than believed
Many LGBTQ people experience some form of violence from their partners at some point, but this often goes unreported and even unnoticed.
In fact, more than 43 percent of lesbian women and 26 percent of gay men in the U.S. have experienced some type of physical intimate partner violence, or IPV, according to sources cited in Dr. Adam Messinger's new book, LGBTQ Intimate Partner Violence: Lessons for Policy, Practice, and Research, published by the University of California Press.
The prevalence rate for physical IPV among bisexual women and men is upwards of 60 percent and 37 percent, respectively, while trans* people reported up to 46 percent, writes Messinger, a professor at Northeastern Illinois University.
In all instances, physical IPV rates were higher for LGBTQ people than for heterosexual cisgender couples, according to the book. The same is true for other types of violence, including psychological violence.
Messinger reviewed more than 600 research publications from various disciplines spanning six continents and four decades of research, in what he says is a comprehensive approach to LGBTQ IPV research.
"Every article I'd read on LGBTQ IPV would begin with the statement, 'there's not a lot of research on this.' And after writing the book I can say, 'that's not entirely true.' There's quite a bit,'" Messinger told Windy City Times.
Rather, LGBTQ IPV research exists but it is segmented by sexual minority and academic discipline, dispersed among scores of hard-to-access databases, Messinger found.
"My hope is that the book raises the national public profile of LGBTQ IPV. It's a real, serious problem," he said.
Myths and barriers
Several myths surround LGBTQ IPV: that it is rare or less severe than violence in heterosexual relationships. There is an assumption that LGBTQ people are inherently nonviolent, especially sexual minority women, according to Messinger.
But this stereotype can prevent "lesbian female victims' ability to recognize that a partner's behavior is in fact abusive rather than normal," Messinger writes.
Similarly, in male same-gender relationships, men are stereotypically viewed to be of similar physical strength and able to "hold their own."
"Men often times report feeling particularly worried about seeking help because no one would believe them and they'll feel like somehow they're less of a man or someone else will say that," Messinger said.
But IPV is not only physical-it also includes psychological, emotional and even "identity" violence, Messinger said.
"For instance, a substantial amount of research has shown that people who are not yet out of the closet about their sexual orientation or their trans* identity to everyone in their lives-and frankly most people aren't out to everyone- leaves them vulnerable to abusers who might use that as leverage to say, 'if you tell anyone about what I'm doing to you or if you leave me, I can out you to your parents, your siblings, to your employer, your friends,'" Messinger said.
Conversely, abusers sometimes pressure victims to remain closeted, especially if the abuser is not out to everyone in their life.
Furthermore, many U.S. states lack anti-discrimination laws protecting LGBTQ people in housing, employment and public accommodation. And barriers for transgender people being able to change their names and gender listed on formal identification "has a ripple effect throughout their lives," Messinger said.
In some states, if one were to pursue a protective order or engage in a civil suit under domestic violence statues, "it's quite possible that that state might require your name and identity to become public."
"That really creates a lot of barriers to being able to ask for help and not have to out yourself at the same time," Messinger said.
"The law is not on the side of LGBTQ people who experience intimate partner violence," making it more difficult for victims to receive help.
Messinger pointed to other myths that make LGBTQ IPV unique: that it should not be discussed out of fear of undermining LBGTQ struggles for equality and that LGBTQ IPV abusers are masculine.
Messinger said he hopes his book draws attention to the issue of LGBTQ IPV "when there is so little in terms of resources and policy being oriented towards this issue." And with all the challenges and unique traits of LGBTQ IPV, customized resources and support are necessary, he said.
He wrote the book as a sort of how-to guide with practical tips and a broad audience in mind-law enforcement, mental and medical health providers, social workers, domestic violence hotline operators, domestic violence shelter staff, policymakers, victims, allies and advocates.
What's next
Messinger reviewed scores of literature published in English, but he said he'd like to see further research in other languages, at a time when same-gender marriage is fully legal in about 22 nations and 15 countries permit joint adoption by same-gender couples.
There is also a lack of research on how LGBTQ IPV intersects with the criminal justice system, he said.
Police are 10 to 30 times more likely to arrest both partners in cases of violence between samegender partners than different-gender partners, Messinger writes.
"It sends the wrong message to the victim that somehow if they seek help, they're the ones who are going to suffer for it," Messinger said.
"Often times that makes it harder for victims to receive services because they're labeled an abuser, making it difficult to get into a shelter," he said.
Messinger is also part of a research team conducting longitudinal research of IPV among youths to see how patterns of abuse change over time.

Center relaunches therapy group for LGBT violence survivors

Author: Smith, Angelique

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/center-relaunches-therapy-group-lgbt-violence/docview/1881096054/se-2?accountid=14696

Abstract: The Anti-Violence Project (AVP) at the Center on Halsted "empowers lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and HIV-affected communities and allies to end all forms of violence through organizing and education, and supports survivors through counseling and advocacy." the Center states. AVP is not primarily grant-funded; we rely on the Center and also get funding through the [federal] Violence Against Women Act [VAWA] and the [Illinois] attorney general's office. Domestic violence in men is often neglected, unnoticed, or treated as mutual fighting, yet one in three bisexual men have experienced intimate partner violence. 6.

Full text:   The Anti-Violence Project (AVP) at the Center on Halsted "empowers lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and HIV-affected communities and allies to end all forms of violence through organizing and education, and supports survivors through counseling and advocacy." the Center states.
Windy City Times spoke with Rachel L. Tillman, a licensed clinical professional counselor who runs the AVP, about her work.
Windy City Times: How did the Center's AntiViolence Project (AVP) come about?
Rachel Tillman: The Center was one of the founding members [in 1995] of the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs [NCAVP], a reporting entity and coalition of 57 members who get together to influence policy on local and national levels. At that time, there wasn't an entity that focused specifically on violence that targets LGBTQ communities.
There was, and still is, a sense that things are underreported. They also wanted to have a little bit more control in how things are reported- instead of grouping men and women together while not even considering sexual orientation. We connect people with resources, from housing to employment, and we offer individual, couples and group therapy. We currently have two groups for survivors of trauma, one of which is the domestic violence/intimate partner violence (DV/ IPV) group that I run. We also have a violence resource line.
WCT: How does the program receive funding?
RT: AVP is not primarily grant-funded; we rely on the Center and also get funding through the [federal] Violence Against Women Act [VAWA] and the [Illinois] attorney general's office.
WCT: How, politically, could that drastically change funding for your program [since VAWA is federal]?
RT: Yeah. That's, in part, why it's very important that we are a coalition, as opposed to oneoff entities. I was just on a call yesterday and we were talking about, "What do we do with the new attorney general and with [the threat to] Violence Against Women Act funding?" Our current funding is through the Illinois attorney general's office, not the federal level.
WCT: Are the volunteers that you work with, in general, Center on Halsted volunteers?
RT: I supervise, recruit and train volunteers, so it's a bit more of a vetting process. It's a three-month minimum commitment because there's a lot of training on how to handle calls. You're dealing with people, oftentimes who are confused, distressed and might not even know they're distressed. People who want to help can also donate, writing "Anti-Violence Project" in the memo line [of a check].
WCT: Are there any statistics that you can give me concerning LGBTQ DV/IPV that you think people would be surprised to hear?
RT: Sixty-eight percent of our callers identify as men. The Center has a reputation for being a gay male organization and that might be why men, in particular, know that we're safe to call. But it is a bit alarming that our stats are a bit reversed, gender-wise.
The problem with that stat is not just the general shock value, but the fact that there is only one DV shelter for men in the whole city and there are at least 22 for women. I can't even count how many males try to go through the court system to get an order of protection, and it's denied because it's perceived that when men are violent, it's mutual. It's an often-neglected area in the field of DV.
WCT: What has been the community reaction to the group?
RT: We have gotten a lot of calls from people who are looking for an LGBT-specific group. There are entities that are very LGBTQ-friendly, but they're not exclusive. We are the only group, to my knowledge, that says, if you identify as straight, we're going to refer you out, just because we want this to feel like a safe group for people who identify as LGBTQ. I want to be very clear, I mean L-G-B-T-Q, so if people identify as bisexual and are in an opposite-sex DV relationship, they are welcome, too. What is often the case is that there's a bi female partnered with a straight male and, oftentimes, her sexuality is used against her in a domestic-violence way.
WCT: What typically happens in a session?
RT: We have a loose curriculum I developed, in collaboration with other materials. We do a mindfulness exercise to get people a little bit more connected to their bodies and aware. Then we have a topical discussion. Oftentimes, we do individual reflection followed by group sharing. The group lasts about 90 minutes and we try to keep it small in size.
WCT: What does Center on Halsted do to ensure the safety and anonymity of group members?
RT: We're bound by HIPAA [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act] law. In order to ensure physical safety, all of the clients have to have a key card to get access to our therapy groups. We also limit people in the group to those who do not identify as offenders. We maintain safety as to not retraumatize.
WCT: What do you think is the main stigma attached to IPV in the LGBTQ community?
RT: Externally, the way people outside of the community-from law enforcement to service providers-minimize, neglect and retraumatize. The other prong is internal, the internal silence in the sense that the community is small. Who can I talk to about this when this person just led an awesome speech at, for example, Dyke March, and nobody is going to believe what she does at home? And then you want me to call the Center where I might know somebody on staff? Where do you go to for support within your own community? That's probably what we see very often.
WCT: How does intersectionality come into play when recommending resources, care and support?
RT: It's absolutely crucial and it's best practice. From ethnicity to immigration status-it all comes into play. It's scary because right now we're dealing with an influx of people who are more afraid to talk about domestic violence because they're undocumented and have deportation fears because of the current political climate. Intersectionality impacts everything we do.

Calls to action
Rachel Tillman, LCPC, followed up with WCT with these calls to action in terms of DV/IPV:
1. Volunteer: Center on Halsted's Anti-Violence Project; RVA (Rape Victims' Advocates); The Network: National.
2. Give: Center on Halsted; other AVPs in states with limited protections (AVP.org).
3. Learn: A crucial dynamic in DV is power and control, not bruises and black eyes.
4. Be: A safe person, not shocked or disbelieving anything when someone in the community starts talking about their relationships: If two in five lesbian women and two out of three bisexual women have experienced violence by an intimate partner, then you've met a survivor or are one.
5. Ask and Notice relationships: Domestic violence in men is often neglected, unnoticed, or treated as mutual fighting, yet one in three bisexual men have experienced intimate partner violence.
6. Kickstart: Seventy-one percent of DV survivors reported being denied emergency shelter due to gender identity. We need more shelters accepting of all gender identities, gender nonbinary, etc.
7. (Safely) Report: Transgender domestic violence is underreported and often the survivor is criminalized (or deported).
8. Call: The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) is up for re-authorization next year-let's ensure that provisions that protect sexual orientation and gender identity remain. Call the U.S. Department of Justice. If you live in a historically red state, contact your state's U.S. representative to voice your support for reauthorization.
9. Show up: The support at airports was amazing-let's also show up at courthouses and ensure that survivors are not arrested-a violation of VAWA.

Abstract: Lipinski voted in support of a GOP version of a bill that would have stripped expanded language on protections for gays, lesbians and illegal aliens in a domestic violence bill. 2014:

Full text:   U.S. Rep. Dan Lipinski has the lowest score of any House Democrat on Human Rights Campaign's (HRC) Congressional Rating Index. Among the actions Lipinski has taken, and statements he's made, on LGBT-rights, are the following, according to HRC:
2006: Lipinski voted "present" on a Constitutional Amendment prohibiting marriage equality. Lipinski dismissed the amendment as a Republican ploy at the time, but publicly emphasized his opposition to same-sex marriage.
2007: Lipinski voted against H.R. 3685, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act Of 2007 (ENDA).
2009: Lipinski voted in favor of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.
2010: Lipinski voted to repeal the military's anti-gay "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy. He said at the time that a congressional repeal was needed so that the military would not be disrupted by a more sudden repeal in the courts.
2011: Lipinski was one of nine Democrats who voted to uphold the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).
2011: Lipinski Voted in favor of an amendment to the Defense Appropriations Bill which stated, "No funds under the act may be used for activities in contravention of ... the Defense of Marriage Act."
2011: When speaking about DOMA to Chicago Sun-Times, Lipinski said, "'I do not support same-sex marriage. ... [DOMA] protects the longstanding tradition of marriage, and serves as a strong commitment by the federal government to protecting the core values of this country in any future policymaking decisions."
2013: Lipinski cosponsored an early bill similar to the First American Defense Act (FADA) legislation. The Marriage and Religious Freedom Act would have prohibited retaliation through the federal tax code against individuals or institutions that exercised "religious conscience regarding marriage as the union of one man and one woman."
2013: Lipinski voted in support of a GOP version of a bill that would have stripped expanded language on protections for gays, lesbians and illegal aliens in a domestic violence bill.
2014: In an Illinois Family Institute Voter guide, Lipinski said he supported a marriage amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman, as well as legislation that prohibited the Justice Department from undermining DOMA. Lipinski also said that he opposed ENDA.
2015: Lipinski was the only Democrat who co-sponsored FADA.
2015: Lipinski voted "present" on an amendment reinforcing the Obama order protecting LGBT employees of federal contractors.

Full text:   Ever since the early morning hours of Nov. 9, 2016-when it was clear that our country elected an incompetent, inexperienced, sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic and admitted sex offender to be the 45th president of the United States of America-I have been barely able to write anything more than social-media posts.
I have spent the time since that date doing more "acting" than writing. But I think I have my voice back.
For 33 years, I have covered the LGBTQ community, and the mainstream Chicago world. Sometimes my journalism work, and my work as a publisher, parallels a need to also act, whether that was doing the March on Springfield for Marriage Equality, the summit on youth homelessness, tiny homes or the Gay Games in 2006.
This time, it was being part of the leadership of the Women's March on Chicago.
The three co-chairs of the march-Ann Scholhamer, Liz Radford and Jessica Scheller-were extremely open to including myself and others as part of their leadership team. The three of them were new to this type of organizing, and they quickly built up a collaborative team around them to create a stellar march that brought together 250,000 women and their allies to downtown Chicago Jan. 21, part of more than 600 marches around the world that attracted millions of people.
The same openness was true of the Illinois delegation to the March on Washington-Mrinalini Chakraborty, Leni Manaa-Hoppenworth, Amanda Drenth, Amanda Jane Long, Julie List and Amber Hummel.
More than a 100 Chicago-area organizations- some nonprofit, some political-also helped. From experienced groups including Chicago Women Take Action, NOW, Planned Parenthood, Operation PUSH, Pride Action Tank and SEIU Healthcare to newer groups and many individuals, the marches attracted an incredible team.
I know that for some of the people I cover and work with, they wonder why many people have not marched in the streets for the injustices that occurred even under President Obama. There were immigrants in horrible detention centers, deportations, and much injustice the past eight years, most of it not under his control, but still happening, from police violence to under-resourced communities. Not everyone benefitted from the successes under Obama, and Obama himself was strangled by the GOP-we should have been in the streets against the GOP long ago.
But we are here now, so we need to respond. Perhaps this catastrophe's main benefit will be in bringing people together across the movements, from Black Lives Matter and Black Youth Project 100 to trans and LGBTQ rights, healthcare, homelessness, raising the minimum wage, immigrant justice, gun violence and many inter-connected issues.
Forward movement
So how do we move forward?
There are dozens if not hundreds of new national and local groups created to respond to the new American order. But we also can't forget that there are existing institutions with great resources that can also be marshaled.
There will be no one right way to dismantle this horror. Likely most of the 250,000 people at Chicago's march, and the thousands of Illinoisans who went to D.C., are already engaged in some form of activism. It may be just online, or with a religious or school group, but right now, everything matters. At the very least, they have a network of friends and family they can help activate.
In addition, the organizations that did the marches have assets-including their access to attendees who signed up for their social media accounts. In fact, we are working to piggyback the annual Peggy Notebaert Volunteer Expo Feb. 26 to make sure to push for volunteers to the groups that helped support the marches.
So using all of these networks will be key to fight the regime. But some of this work should be done regardless of who occupies the White House, because the needs are so great on the ground in all 50 states. The federal government is not the only solution to the problems facing Chicagoans-it is only part of what is needed. So now that it will likely abdicate its responsibilities and privatize much of what should be government's role in the safety net, it's going to be up to well-resourced people and groups to help those who do not have access to resources.
Here are a few ideas:
-Wealthy progressives, and anyone with disposable income, need to step up to the plate more than they ever have. They need to look beyond their social circles, and typical nonprofits they back, to a long list of social justice and social service groups. Get out of your comfort zone and give money to the Fight for $15, to Black Lives Matter, BYP100, the Immigrant Youth Justice League, Pride Action Tank, SEIU Healthcare, Planned Parenthood, Chicago Survivors, domestic violence and homeless groups, among many others. There will also be new groups, such as Rise Movement-explore, explore, explore, for the new and innovative, and the tried and true.
-Politics is both national and local. The Democratic Party has always felt like a factory system, where you "do your time" and you get rewarded with that next open seat. That process has not created a deep pool of candidates that can speak to the people, and crush the gerrymandering attempts of the GOP. To "rise up" the party must have a better way to allow for innovation, for charismatic, passionate candidates and leadership who don't play by the old rules, who can attract new voters and bring life back into the party.
-The relatively new tools of social media can be exploited in great ways to help social-justice and social-service groups. We have not done a good job of coalition building in the past because each group often is very proprietary of their connections to money and other assets. This has to stop. No one is asking for the massive institutions to give away their email lists. But wouldn't it be great for the institutions to work together to better cross promote events and needs to lesser-resourced groups?
Here are some examples. The Women's March on Chicago and the Illinois delegation to D.C. have large social media followings. In addition, many groups supported these efforts, and they each have followings on social media. A cross-promotion of fundraising could happen for the groups. Yes, there would be limitations based on some groups being non-partisan, but I am mainly talking about social justice groups and services, not candidates and political action committees.
So, here is how it could work. Each week, for 52 weeks a year, every partner group agrees to promote an online fundraising campaign for the selected social justice groups that week. The emphasis being on smaller groups (maybe one large and two small social justice groups each week). In addition, everyone would agree to post a list of actions happening among these groups, to all of their social media channels. This could be an anti-violence or immigration-rights protest, or a march in front of a religious institution that has been vandalized, or a push for a responsible budget in Illinois. Partners could "opt out" if the action violates their nonprofit status.
Why should larger and smaller groups do this, when it might cut into their own efforts? First, I believe firmly that when you help others you help yourself. That is true for individuals, businesses and nonprofits. When I see Planned Parenthood or Lambda Legal helping others, or working in coalition, I am much more likely to support them. Second, we are in a time now where we must lift all boats. All means all. If funds are being cut to all domestic violence services in Illinois, we need a statewide call to action and fundraising. Same for youth homeless services. And for acting up when there is a police shooting against an unarmed young African-American on Chicago's South Side.
This is what being a good ally is all about.
-Corporations that value their employees and customers must also figure out a way to be part of the solution. During the battle for LGBTQ rights, corporate allies have played an increasing role of support, and clout. They have helped fight against anti-LGBTQ legislation, some going so far as to boycott cities and states doing bad deeds. They must now look to expand this social justice mission to other areas where they can have influence-which is almost everywhere. Now that corporations are "people," they have a much louder voice in politics, and we as consumers can pressure them to use that voice for good (while at the same time fighting the notion that they are people!). Corporations, and their employee resources groups, also can move on social justice issues, raising funds, and providing free talent and resources, to numerous issues under attack.
-Some religious organizations have always been social justice-oriented. But many others do little to nothing to provide money, space or other resources to issues outside of their geographic zones. Even within their zones, many do not provide help to those most in need. All need to step it up, and that could mean with food, space for meetings, shelter, fundraising or political action.
I could go on and on with ideas, but I will leave more for another day.
Staying active in the resistance
I have been fighting for social justice since high school and college, but especially since 1984, when I started work in LGBTQ media. I have seen many activists and groups come and go, some quickly, some that last many years. I have been asked about my ability to stay connected without a break in 33 years. (I guess this is my Jesus year of official activism/journalism.)
First, it is not for everyone. Some people have a huge spark and give their all for one to three years, and then they have to check out for valid reasons.
Second, some of the absolute worst that I have experienced has come from people within the community, not outside of it. The outside forces are usually a nebulous entity without specific form. But those inside a community have the ability to really de-motivate and do damage to their peers, like crabs in a tank who don't work together to get out, but pull each other down. You can't let that get to you-move on to a different organization if some peer-to-peer work is damaging.
Third, do not think you can do it all. I work deeply on some issues, and then support others in more surface ways. I care about so many issues (LGBTQ and otherwise), but I know I can't help them all. But I can do small things for every issue, even if it's a tweet, or going to an event or protest.
Fourth, and I can't emphasize this one enough, I love what I do, and I have a lot of fun doing it. I have met incredible people through all of these projects, including recently with these two march groups. You have to enjoy it, and have some fun, to sustain. This work can nourish you and make you feel connected and vital. If you don't love it, leave it.
Finally, assess what you really have to give, both in time and money, and divide it the best way you can. Even $5 a week to a small group means a lot, or one hour a month can help another.
Right now, everyone needs to dig deep. Deep can be $1 or $1 million. Deep can be one hour a month or 10 hours a week. It can be anything you are able to do-just do something.

Full text:   The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) has learned of the homicide of Mesha Caldwell, a Black transgender woman who was killed in Canton, Mississippi on Jan. 4. She is the first recorded trans individual murdered in the United States in 2017.
According to Mic, she was initially misgendered by local press.
However, other trans individuals have been fatally attacked over December and early January. A transgender Virginia resident known to friends as India Monroe was killed on Dec. 21 in Newport News, Virginia-but was misgendered and identified by her birth name in news reports, Mic.com reported. The Newport News police are reportedly investigating Monroe's death as a domestic incident, not a hate crime.
In Pennsylvania, 23-year-old transgender man Sean Hake was fatally shot, according to PGHLesbian.com. Mercer County District Attorney Miles K. Karson Jr. said initially that he could not comment on the open investigation, and that he expected to release more information at a news conference, possibly on Jan. 11. According to WPXI.com, Hake was killed in an officer-involved shooting after police responded to a domestic assault.
In addition, South Dakota transgender woman Jamie Lee Wounded Arrow, 28, was found dead Jan. 6 in her apartment in an apparent homicide, LGBTQ Nation reported. Sioux Falls Two-Spirit and Allies noted that Wounded Arrow was originally from the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota and was a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe.
NCAVP's most recent hate violence report, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and HIV-Affected Hate Violence in 2015, recorded 24 reported hate violence homicides of LGBTQ people-a 20-percent increase from the 20 reported anti-LGBTQ homicides in 2014.

Abstract: My task was to conduct in-depth interviews with families in the area to determine their religious affiliations and their spiritual needs. After some preliminary chit-chat, she asked me if it was true that Catholic doctrine taught that a wife had to submit to the sexual demands of her husband under any and all circumstances whether she wanted to have sex or not. I was stunned. I had never in all my years of theological training encountered this question.

Full text:   In the early 1960s, when I was in pastoral training in Oil City and in Elwood City, Pennsylvania, I met a woman who changed my world.
My task was to conduct in-depth interviews with families in the area to determine their religious affiliations and their spiritual needs. After some preliminary chit-chat, she asked me if it was true that Catholic doctrine taught that a wife had to submit to the sexual demands of her husband under any and all circumstances whether she wanted to have sex or not. I was stunned. I had never in all my years of theological training encountered this question. Almost without thinking, I reactively said: "That is not sex; it is RAPE." She replied: "My confessor says that I must have sex with my husband whenever he wants it."
I took this question to my supervisor, an old Irish priest, who affirmed my judgment on the matter. But, he added: "Unfortunately, too many priests believe and teach this justification of sexual abuse."
His affirmation of my opinion was small consolation because I realized I could not really help this woman. There was no way I could offer her any real support through the Catholic Church or any other agency available to me at that time.
In the following weeks, I came to understand that this woman's story was not exceptional: many women suffered sexual abuse because of this perverse understanding of marriage in Christian traditions, in some cases based on an interpretation of the thinking of Paul as stated in Corinthians 7:3-6. These understandings had been codified into our legal system under the rubrics of 'spousal exemptions' and 'marital rights,' and other legal formulations of the issue of sexual violence in marriage which seemed to preclude the possibility of rape in marriage.
My encounter with this woman set me off on my own journey into the meaning of human sexuality and sexual freedom.
Religion has three essential functions in society: 1) to conserve and protect the traditional morals and customs; 2) to critique and reform the traditional morals and customs; and 3) to break open traditional forms for creating new morals and customs. In practice, the first function of religion-to conserve and protect the traditional mores-usually dominates.
Honor Killings (the right of male members of a family to kill female members who are perceived to bring shame on the family), Sati (the duty of the widow to throw herself on the funeral pyre of her husband), Patriarchy (unconstrained male domination of women and children), for examples, are cultural values made sacred by religious authority.
Violence against women, often sanctioned by religion, is a worldwide pandemic, systematic rather than episodic, structural rather than incidental. The statistics are overwhelming and hard to absorb: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Violence_against_women .
Two hundred million women have undergone female genital mutilation; 700 million women were married as children and/or forced into marriages; women and girls constitute 70% of human traffic victims; at least 35% of women have endured sexual and physical abuse. (SEE: United Nations: Ending Violence Against Women and Girls.)
In Pakistan, honor killings are epidemic (BBC 01 April 2016 https://goo.gl/GYZakm ), official data indicates 1,100 such murders in 2015. In Mexico, sexual violence is used by civil and military authorities to socially control women (Amnesty International 28 June 2016 https://goo. gl/BKI7vW )
Violence against women is a political tool to silence women writers and activists.
Nov. 25, 2016, International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women began a 16-day focus on initiatives to stop violence against women (through Dec. 10). Violence-especially sexual violence-against women is used as a political tool to keep women writers and activists silent. Every year outstanding women are murdered to silence their voices. This year the Honduran indigenous environmental activist Berta Caceres was assassinated in her home after years of threats on her life. Many people and organizations knew that the life of Berta Caceres was in jeopardy but could not find a way to save her. The same was true for Anna Politkovskaya, the great Russian journalist. These women knew that their murders were only a matter of time. It seems that the only way to save such heroic women is for them to silence themselves.
Particular cases can be overwhelming and statistics can be mind-numbing. We must keep in mind that each single number is one human person. We must not fail to act. In our own country, we must work to make our religious traditions resources for the education, liberation, and empowerment of women.
Each woman or girl has her story to tell. We must learn to listen.

Full text:   [Note: The names are fictional and the couple described is a composite of numerous couples I counseled on interpersonal violence (IPV).]
The Jills were the envy among us lesbian couples of African descent. Their public display of love for each other and their exchanges of their special terms of endearment was the stuff you read in romance novels. They were inseparable, and we distinguished them by calling them Jill and Jillie.
When I received the call that one was being seen in the ER and other one was being detained by the police for battering, I knew it had to be a mistake. But looking back there were visible signs of interpersonal violence (IPV) that we sistah-friends came to understand and wished we could have intervened on their behalf. But we were so enamored, envious and awestruck by their oversized demonstrative displays of love and seeming respect for each other, we didn't see their troubled marriage.
October is Domestic Awareness Month, and within LGBTQ communities of color, not enough attention, education, intervention and advocacy are given to this issue.
The 2014 Advocate article "2 Studies That Prove Domestic Violence is an LGBT issue" reports that "21.5 percent of men and 35.4 percent of women living with a same-sex partner experienced intimate-partner physical violence in their lifetimes. ... Transgender respondents had an incidence of 34.6 percent over a lifetime according to a Massachusetts survey." An interpersonal Violence (IPV) study conducted in 2011 stated that LGBTQ communities of color are one of the demographic groups experiencing high incidents of domestic violence.
However, obtaining accurate statistics of how high IPV is in these communities is obfuscated by social stigmas and cultural taboos, and there are also racism as well as other forms of oppressions and discriminations.
What also interferes in obtaining accurate statistics on how high IPV is in these communities of color is that same-gender interpersonal violence is clouded with myths. And within these communities there are several cultural barriers preventing reporting domestic violence and receiving interventive services.
The Black Church is one of them.
Jill grew up in the church and whenever troubled and heavy burdened she took her woes and concerns there. The network of support through prayer and counselling wasn't available to Jill and her spouse once she came out.
Even in 2016, many Black churches are woefully far behind the country's acceptance of LGBTQ Americans. These places of worship are still spewing homophobic rhetoric from their bully pulpits. And, unfortunately, some LGBTQ victims of IPV have internalized the church's message that they are abominations to God and, therefore, deserved to be abused, flogged and beaten.
"I thought I showed strength by staying in the relationship. I thought if we acted happy we would become happy," Jill stated.
With too many churches espousing a theology emphasizing the place and value of suffering in one's life as a test from God like that of the biblical Job coupled with the marriage vow "for richer or poorer until death do us part" the act forgiveness is seductively elevated as both redemptive and virtuous that too many LGBTQ victims remain in abusive relationships.
The politic of silence is another cultural barrier preventing reporting domestic violence and receiving interventive services.
While silence diminishes a deleterious white gaze on the Black community-past and present-we need to address problems plaguing our communities, like HIV/AIDS, mental illness, suicide and IPV, to name a few. Rather than addressing these problems, they are spun into a damaging discourse of blame, shame, stigma and misinformation. And with many of us having to confront the daily microaggressions of racism and homophobia in the workplace and out in the world, the last thing many LGBTQ victims want to tackle is IPV at home, often considered a "safe space."
Jill's spouse suffered from bipolar disorder and always attributed her spouse's violence to her mood changes. Looking back, we sisterfriends only saw the couple during what they depicted as being "jubilantly high on love."
The dominant view by both healthcare professions and law-enforcement officers is that communities of color, especially of African descent, have a predisposition toward violence that gravely interferes with victims taking action and a community raising awareness.
With a cultural distrust of law-enforcement officers due to the rash of shootings and killings of unarmed Black men and women in streets, most in my community-straight or LGBTQ-call for them only in extreme dire situations, with prayers and hopes of no fatalities. Consequently, victims of IPV, especially LGBTQs, are not taken seriously.
For example, the myth that since both the victim and the abuser are of the same gender and are also in a consensual sexual relationship may lead many officers to confuse same-gender sexual violence as part and parcel of being homosexual.
Healthcare disparities in communities of color and LGBTQs are only exacerbated for LGBTQ people of color. Sadly, this creates distrust as well as a lack and underutilization of resources toward healing, moving on and prevention.
The Jills have finally separated-but not because of police intervention or heathcare prevention. We sister-friends stepped in. Not everyone has a support system.
Resources and services have to be made available to LGBTQ communities of color. And this is the time to reach out to us. Everyone deserves a safe, loving, healthy and violentfree relationship.

Abstract: There's almost like a double-closeting effect," she added. "It's difficult to be out as bisexual when you have so much judgment about bisexual people, not just from the heterosexual community, but from the gay and lesbian community. If a woman is bisexual, lesbians look at her like she is less legitimate.

Full text:   Headnote MAP report shows shocking disparities in the bisexual community
On Sept. 27, the national, independent LGBTQ think tank The Movement Advancement Project (MAP), in partnership with 10 U.S. advocacy organizations, released a major new report on the disparities faced by one group within the LGBTQ umbrella.
The report detailed inequalities the group (representing 52 percent of the LGB population) faces including a lack of support from family members and friends, harassment and sometimes violent bullying in school, disproportionately high rates of workplace discrimination, chronic homelessness, difficulty seeking asylum or navigating the immigration process, lifelong mental health and physical issues including relationship problems and isolation, an inordinately high level of risk behavior such as drug and tobacco use, suicide attempts, weight management problems, higher rates of breast cancer, HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, cardiovascular disease, problems receiving adequate healthcare as well as a horrifying level of violence whether through intimate partner and domestic abuse, rape or sexual assault.
MAP cited a student in a 2014 Human Rights Campaign (HRC) survey who said that "I've had people tell me that my life is worthless and that I'm nothing."
A participant in a Columbia University study, also quoted in the report, said "I'll never tell anyone. I'll go to my grave with this."
The subject of the report was a group whose history has been dated back to ancient civilizations including Greece, Rome, Persia and India. They have included some of history's most renowned artists, poets, authors, singers, actors, scientists, kings, queens and emperors.
They have been a part of the LGBTQ acronym since the 1990s, yet they are rarely found marching openly within the ranks of a Pride Parade.
In fact, most feel they are invisible and, worse still, are victims of widespread discrimination and uninformed assumptions on the part of gays, lesbians and even transgender community members.
They are bisexua~ peop~e and, it seems until very recently, no one has wanted to talk about them.
Heron Greenesmith, Esq., is MAP's LGBT movement and senior policy analyst. They (preferred pronoun) are also the lead author of the report Invisible Majority: The Disparities Facing Bisexual People And How to Remedy Them.
"Last year, a group of bisexual advocates came together in Washington, D.C. for the firstever briefing on the disparities facing bisexual people," Greenesmith told Windy City Times. "It was off-the-record but the documents drafted for that briefing created the foundation for this report. We started 18 months ago with those documents, pulled together existing research and fleshed out our recommendations."
There were five bisexual nonprofits and advocacy organizations who contributed to or will help disseminate the report: BiNet USA, The Bisexual Organizing Project (BOP), The Bisexual Resource Center (BRC), The Bi Queer Alliance Chicago and The Los Angeles Bi Task Force (LABTF).
Bi Queer Alliance Chicago representative Noel Spain told Windy City Times that the group "provided feedback to MAP on earlier drafts of the report." (See separate story for information on the work of Bi Queer Alliance Chicago.)
Robert Ozn is the chair of LABTF. Identifying as a bisexual, cisgender male, Ozn is currently involved in a polyamorous relationship. His partner is male and Ozn also has a girlfriend- an experience he describes as "incredibly fulfilling."
A professional musician, Ozn's single "Je Suis Paris-I Am Orlando" has been a hit in Europe's dance clubs and currently sits at No. 15 on the British Music Week charts.
He told Windy City Times that his organization has not only publicly supported the MAP report but that they intend to distribute it to advocacy groups such as the Lesbian and Gay Advisory Board of West Hollywood, the Los Angeles mayor's office and LGBT reporters in California.
"Bisexual issues have been, for the most part, ignored by the Southern California LGBT press," Ozn said. "So we want to reach out to them and make something happen."
The reason for that is demonstrated in the final and released version of MAP"s narrative. It is shocking.
"Bisexual people are frequently swept into the greater lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) community, their specific disparities made invisible within data about the LGB community as a whole," it begins. "Bisexual people's sexuality is often invisible in broader society: bisexual people are often assumed to be gay, lesbian, or heterosexual based on the gender of their partner. Yet, when bisexual people are open about their sexuality, they face increased levels of violence from intimate partners; rejection by community, family, and peers; and skepticism from the people and organizations whom they turn to for help, resources, and services."
Yet, according to the report, "People who identify as bisexual comprise about half of lesbian, gay and bisexual people in the United States. Of respondents to the [2011] National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 23 [percent] reported identifying as bisexual and another 20 [percent] as queer."
"Two-thirds of LGB parents are bisexual," it adds, "Approximately 59 [percent] of bisexual women and 32 [percent] of bisexual men have had children. The majority of bisexual people in relationships are in relationships with people of the opposite sex. 84 percent of bisexual people in a committed relationship are involved with someone of the opposite sex. Another four [percent] of bisexual people have a spouse or partner who is transgender."
Using the sometimes scant research data currently available, MAP's report reveals "the extent to which bisexual people face bias from their families, communities (including the LGBT community) and society as a whole."
It noted that "only 33 [percent] of bisexual people had ever attended a Pride event and only 20 percent said there is a lot of social acceptance of LGB people where they live."
It went on to detail how, in educational settings, "29 percent of bisexual youth reported being frequently or often verbally harassed. 24 [percent] of bisexual youth and 32 [percent]of pansexual youth reported frequently or often being excluded by peers for being different."
MAP cited a 2015 study which noted that, "Bisexual women were 64 [percent] less likely to have graduated high school and 48 [percent] less likely to have ever enrolled in college than 'completely heterosexual' respondents; and bisexual men were 45 [percent] less likely to enroll in college than 'completely heterosexual' men."
"Harassment, exclusion and lack of support at school may be compounded for some bisexual youth leading to higher prevalence of risk behaviors, including substance abuse," the report stated while stressing that "a growing body of research shows that bisexual youth experience unique challenges and barriers that may put them at an increased risk of experiencing homelessness."
Life for bisexual people is not much better in the workplace, despite a growing number of companies boasting LGBT Employee Resource Groups (ERGs).
"A 2011 study by the Williams Institute found that only six [percent] of bisexual people reported being open about their sexual orientation to all their coworkers, compared to 40 [percent] of lesbian and gay people," the report noted.
It added that employment discrimination has taken a toll on both the health and well-being of bisexual people and their earning power with a Pew Research Center Study finding that "48 [percent] of bisexual respondents reported an annual family income of less than $30,000."
The mental health of bisexual people is markedly poor due to rejection and isolation.
"Data analyzed from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found that bisexual behavior (defined in the survey as having had sex with 'both males and females') conferred the greatest odds of having any mood or anxiety disorder," MAP asserted. "In the general population, mental health conditions have been found to contribute significantly to suicide, although many other individual, interpersonal, communi ty, and societal factors clearly increase suicide risk. In a 2010 study in Canada, bisexual men were six times more likely than heterosexual men to report seriously considering suicide at some point in their lives."
An equally disturbing aspect of MAP's report concerned the levels of violence experienced by bisexual people. It cited 2013 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) figures which found that 61[percent] of bisexual women and 37 [percent] of bisexual men reported experiencing rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner at some point in their lifetime."
"The same study found that 46 [percent] of bisexual women had been raped," it continued. "Forty-seven [percent] of bisexual men and 75 [percent] of bisexual women reported experiencing any sexual violence other than rape from any perpetrator across their lifetime. Bisexual women survivors reported feeling isolated from LGBTQ people and from the broader community and often did not disclose their bisexual identity when accessing services for intimate partner violence."
"Bisexual people face bias on many fronts," MAP asserted, "from friends and family; from service providers and employers; from heterosexual people; but also, often from gay and lesbian people. This bias, when combined with the interpersonal and legal discrimination that constitute minority stress, creates unique and specific negative outcomes for bisexual people."
It raises the question of why bisexual individuals are either targeted or ignored completely, in particular, by members of the broader LGT umbrella.
"Politically and socially, we are 30 years behind the lesbian and gay community," Ozn said. "The disappointing fact of life is that they are not sharing their influence with us. As recently as three weeks ago, the West Hollywood Lesbian and Gay Advisory Board turned down, by a vote, an opportunity to recommend to the city council that bisexuals have representation in the advisory board structure."
Ozn added that the advisory board also refused representation of any kind.
"For that kind of discrimination to be going on in 2016 is shocking to me," he stated.
"We have data pointing to disparities but we don't have a lot of research into the origins of the bias and discrimination against bisexual people," Greenesmith said. "There is some speculation by some researchers that myths and stereotypes lead to that bias-myths about cheating, stereotypes about confusion."
Red Schulte is a Chicago community organizer and queer-identified woman who is openly bisexual.
"When I was very young, I thought it was a normal way of being," they said. "In elementary school, I remember playground or sleepover interactions with friends and feeling the same way about them and being intrigued by personalities. In fifth or sixth grade, I would comment about liking a girl as a boyfriend and that was not OK with teachers and peers. I made the fatal mistake of saying something very innocent and honest and I was shut down quickly."
"At middle school age, I had a lot of interests," Schulte added. "People were constantly finding my notebook which had lists of people who I liked in it. Those lists were populated by the names of boys and girls. It was just a given for me. Of course the notebook got passed around the classroom and I got made fun of."
Schulte, who grew up in a small Texas town, recalled that 'Dyke' was hurled against them as an epithet quite frequently.
"It wasn't until later in college that I felt a kindred love for that term because I found a feminist community and a group of people who were taking it back," they said. "I've since gone through multiple expressions of gender performativity-more femme or more butch presentations."
Schulte said they didn't know about the term bisexual until around the sixth grade.
"It was the early '90s, the era of Jerry Springer and Maury Povich, who were parading people on these shows to be ridiculed," they recalled. "I have a sense that's where people were getting conceptions of difference. But I remember rooting for the people on these shows and getting very upset at the questions being asked from the audience. The word bisexual was bandied about in school in a curious sense. It was a new word for me but I remember it making sense and being like 'that's me. I like both people!'"
Schulte recalled dating as a struggle.
"People don't accept or believe that your sexual orientation and desires are valid, legitimate or even real," they said. "There have been plenty of people both in the queer community and outside of it who have been like 'Just make up your mind. Just decide. Pick one. You're only half way out of the closet.' These are actual things that have been said to me and others that I know."
Schulte is currently in a serious relationship with a queer-identified cisgender male.
"When we are outside together on a date, we present as straight to people who want to perceive us as such," Schulte said. "When we got to queer community events, there's some who are 'looking' at us. Even though our identities, desires, orientations and loved experiences are queer, people don't like how 'straight' we look."
Miriam and Alan Insley Churchill are a cisgender, queer, polyamorous couple living in Chicago. They have been together for over four years and were married on the day of the 2016 Pride Parade. Alan is a senior software engineer and Miriam is a student and aspiring novelist. Each prefer they, them and theirs pronouns.
Introduced by a family friend of Alan's, the couple were friends at first during which time Miriam was dating a transgender woman named Sarah and Alan was going through a divorce.
"I am bi but I find I am much more attracted to people who are attracted to me," Alan noted. "My sexuality is tied to my emotional feelings. I fantasized about men and women all my life. I find women's bodies very attractive. I also find large shoulders attractive. I went to Catholic School and kept failing until I switched to public school. During my first marriage, sex became torturous. There was some depression and I stopped being able to work well. I had a plan to kill myself. You find that you can't escape yourself. The hurt is inside and there is no running away from how you feel."
Instead, Alan found a therapist and began to research their sexual identity.
"My body felt fluid to me and my sexuality would change based on how my body felt," they explained. "So if my body felt more feminine, I was attracted to men. When it felt more masculine, I was attracted to women."
Alan added that they didn't see a place where they could come out.
"There was no one I could ever come to and say 'look that this that I've discovered about myself' because nobody cares," they said. "I talked to my dad about it and he was fine. My kids were already upset about the divorce. My being bi gave them another reason to be angry. My friends who are straight are a little less friendly. You can tell they are uncomfortable with it."
Miriam remembered a crush on their music teacher when they were 13.
"I told two of my friends in junior high," they said. "One of them told the whole school. I was out to the local high school before I even went there because people in junior high told them I was gay. So I was labelled that way even though I started to discover an attraction for men."
Miriam added that their first kiss with a man was as electric as it was confusing.
"I felt like it compromised my identity and my politics," they said. "I spent a whole bunch of years wondering 'am I gay or am I bi?' I wasn't trying to find a label, I was trying to find out how I was going to be happy with a future partner. When I got to college, I heard the term 'queer' and I liked that a lot better. My sexuality is fluid, I'm not always 50 percent attracted to men or women. I go with queer because it's not heteronormative."
Miriam has suffered from severe depression for as long as they can remember.
"I think my identity maybe magnified it because I grew up in a small town," they said. "But it was mostly chemical. I didn't tell anybody about my identity. It's hard to come out because there is a bisexual invisibility. When I'm with Alan, people assume that I'm straight. When I go to the Pride Parade, people assume all kinds of things."
Like Schulte, Miriam found that misconceptions about bisexual people made dating a challenge.
"When I was dating Sarah, she was afraid I was going to cheat on her with a man," they said. "On the flip side of that, you have men who want to date you because they think they are going to get a ménage à trois and that you will do anything because you are bisexual. That labels you in a lot of bad ways. It's very isolating because lesbians don't want to date you and a lot of the bi-chicks who do already have men as their primary partners. When I was single, that mattered a lot because there weren't many women to date. Now that I am with Alan, it's complicated to explain on dates that I am married but free to have a relationship even though I'm not going to leave my husband."
When, during the course of the couple's relationship, Alan went on a date with a man named Frank, Miriam admitted to a little jealousy.
"I always say that loving other people doesn't diminish the love I have for Miriam," Alan said. "It's not like it's a bucket of water that's measurable. Though I don't like to see Miriam hurt."
"But jealousy is a petty emotion that I need to get over and I recognize that," Miriam said. "That's how a poly relationship works. It evolves."
Trans and bisexual
The MAP report noted "some evidence that more transgender people identify as bisexual than non-transgender people."
Christina Kahrl, major league baseball writer for ESPN, is a renowned figure in trans activism both in Chicago and nationwide. Her sexual orientation is bisexual. She has been happily married to a lesbian woman for two-and-a-half years.
"I think that the message that a trans person is worthy of love, can be loved and can love is, I hate to say, a relatively recent development as a publically consumed message," Kahrl noted. "For so long, trans people were fetishized or seen as sexual objects. The idea that we are real people with real emotional lives and a rich need for the same experiences as everybody else has been difficult enough. I think it is doubled because bisexuality adds another layer."
"There's almost like a double-closeting effect," she added. "It's difficult to be out as bisexual when you have so much judgment about bisexual people, not just from the heterosexual community, but from the gay and lesbian community. If a woman is bisexual, lesbians look at her like she is less legitimate. If a man says that he is bisexual, cis heteronormativity and gay men say that, 'You're really just gay and you're just trying to waffle.' You can't win for losing on both counts because everybody looks at you and says 'you're not with us, you must not be one of us,' or 'you really should be one of us and you're just lying to yourself both of which are condescending, ignorant and frustrating to have to deal with."
Kahrl asserted that such misinformed ideology also has an effect on the partners of bisexual people.
"There are some lesbians who look at my wife as something other than a lesbian because she is married to a bisexual trans woman," she said. "No. She's still a lesbian. Being bisexual doesn't mean that we don't believe in committed relationships and can't live happily ever after the same as everybody else. It just means there are people within the cisgender, transgender, gay and lesbian communities who are finding ways to invalidate those kind of relationships because they don't fit within their norms and their easy, pre-printed box of what relationships are supposed to look like."
Kahrl recalled pushback from within the transgender community.
"Some folks try to label any trans woman in a relationship with a cisgender woman as being cisgender and heteronormative-men having sex with women," she said. "It's despicable and stupid but there are those people who feel that, if you are a transgender woman and you are not with men, then somehow you are less trans. Some trans people want to legitimize themselves and delegitimize other trans people because they are different in some way."
"Obviously now I have a broader conception and acceptance of difference and gender spectrum exploration," Schulte said. "As alienated humans we struggle with love, trust and acceptance because we're not taught our own self-worth so why should we be interested in others? Why can't we just love and accept a person as they present themselves or in the plural too, for folks in polyamorous situations, why can't we just trust?"
"We're not trying to hurt each other," Alan said. "But feelings are feelings and it's hard to know what generates them. Exploring them is super healthy. That's what it has meant to me from the beginning and it still does. It's just accepting how you feel, regardless of its source."
"I feel like people don't choose to discriminate. They're not setting out and saying 'we hate bi people' but they're being cautious with their emotions, they feel more emotionally threatened by bisexuals," Miriam added. "Also, in some circles, there's a very gay or lesbian culture and they want you to fit into it."
Not 'this' or 'that'
"I think a key element here is that bisexual people simply are," Kahrl said. "There's a component within communities of identity that's about creating an identity and fulfilling it. Bi people are just reacting or responding to their own sexuality not some broadly generated understanding of what it means to be gay, lesbian or trans. We are not 'this' or 'that.' We are an 'and.' We don't need to fill any good-to-go boxes. We just want to live our own lives and wind up in relationships with the people that we love same as everybody else."
Following the 18th annual Bisexual Awareness Day Sept. 23, the White House Office of Public Engagement hosted "over 100 advocates for a community briefing on advancing equality for members of the bisexual community."
In a statement on the White House blog, Outreach & Recruitment Director for the Presidential Personnel Office Raffi Freedman-Gurspan noted that, "The community briefing [featured] discussions on the steps that community leaders and Administration officials have taken together to support bisexual Americans. It [also underlined] the challenges ahead in the community, specifically related to disproportionate risks of mental and physical health struggles, poverty, addiction, and violence-and the need for fully inclusive federal non-discrimination protections."
The MAP report offered a series of recommendations including anti-bullying legislation, comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education curricula and support of school Gay Straight Alliances (GSAs), passage of the Equality Act "explicitly prohibiting employment discrimination on the bases of sexual orientation and gender identity," federal expansion of research and data collection, cultural competency guidance for state and local departments of mental health and federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) grantees "including organizational grantees and individual mental health professionals, working with LGBT, and specifically bisexual, youth and adults" and "federal Department of Justice and Department of Health and Human Services guidance on cultural competence to grantees and service providers who serve bisexual survivors of violence."
"This report should serve as a clarion call to policymakers and service providers across the country," MAP concluded. "In order to fully serve the LGBT community, we must also fully serve the bisexual community."

Dawn Valenti: A Chicago survivor's story

Abstract: I don't, I don't, I don't," she repeated emphatically. "Because I have to be their strength. I can't break down. But there's times when I leave the family and I'm in my car down the street and I break down or I go home and I just shut it down. To hear a woman say 'I thought giving birth was the worst thing I had to do' after she walks out of the medical examiner's office identifying her son is hard for me.

Full text:   When trans woman of color T.T. Saffore was found murdered on Chicago's West Side Sept. 11, her grieving family and friends seemingly had nowhere to turn. Like anyone who has lost a loved one to violence, they were in a state of shock.
Clouding their ability to express their devastating grief were questions about what to do next. According to a friend of Saffore, Chicago Police Department investigators did not reach out to the family for at least a week. Why not? Why did this happen? Who was responsible? Where did they have to go to identify and retrieve the body of their loved one in order to give her a decent burial?
There was a completely unknown system into which the family had suddenly and unceremoniously been thrown and had to navigate. Where to start? Why was no one listening to them?
Into their lives came Dawn Valenti, a crisis responder with Chicago Survivors.
The nonprofit, which operates on the upper floor offices of a South Side church, was founded in 2010 by Joy McCormack in the aftermath of her son Frankie's murder.
According to its website, Chicago Survivors "staff meet families at the worst moment of their lives and-day by day-accompany them through the unfamiliar systems, unwanted experiences, and unwelcome feelings so that no one has to face them alone."
From the crime scene, to the hospital, to helping communicate with CPD and the medical examiner's office to coordinating with the funeral home and "wherever needed," the Chicago Survivors crisis response team is there for the family like an unexpected but essential friend offering not only the time needed to grieve, but they also listen patiently and sympathetically as the emotions contained within that grief finds its myriad of voices.
With almost 600 homicides reported in Chicago since January, this year Chicago Survivors staff has been stretched to the extreme. Their office and cell phones are always ringing and not even a brief interview with Windy City Times can pass without an urgent call. But they take it in their stride no matter what the hour of the day or night. They each know how invaluable their work is.
Valenti has been a part of Chicago Survivors since its very beginning as a program of Chicago Citizens for Change. She also was the organizer of Chicago's first vigil in response to the murders of 49 people at an LGBT club, The Pulse, in Orlando. That vigil brought together the LGBTQ community and families in Chicago who had lost their children to gun violence.
On first appearances, Valenti is an imposing figure.
"I like tattoos, I ride a motorcycle," she said. "But I tell people all the time 'don't judge the book by its cover. If you want to get to know me, open me up and read me.'"
Inside those pages is an extraordinary life born into horrific violence and abuse, in what is now the Roscoe Village neighborhood of Chicago, but shaped in determination, spiritual and self-belief and her unwavering love for people.
Valenti has accumulated certifications which include life coaching, psychological first aid and as a domestic violence and sexual assault advocate. She also has the kind of experience for the job no one would want on their resume but which would eventually chart the course of her life both professionally and as the most openhanded of defenders.
"I come from a home where my mother was battered and I was sexually abused probably as early as five years old," she said. "My mom's boyfriend and the father of my three younger siblings was an alcoholic and all-around bad guy. He abused me. My older sister has been on drugs all her life. She used to sleep with a knife under her pillow and, to this day, she still does. He destroyed our family. Whenever he was there, it was uncomfortable and I would leave the house. There were times when I didn't want to be there at all so, at about 11 years old, I started running away. No matter where I ran, my mom always found me, but I didn't want to be at home. It didn't feel safe."
Valenti grew up in the '70s, when domestic violence was as much of a reality as it is today-but completely unaddressed.
"My mom's boyfriend would beat the crap out of her," she said. "She'd call the police and he would come back a few weeks later. For me it was normal. What happened to me dampened the relationship with the woman who gave birth to me. I call her that because I don't have a mother. She always treated me differently. When I was 21, I told my mom what happened to me, she just dropped me off and wanted to be alone. She was always there for me when I was in trouble but, when I was an adult and changed my life, she was not there for me. The last time I talked with her was Mother's Day three years ago and that conversation didn't go very well. She told me I wasn't her daughter anymore and she never wanted to see me again."
"I didn't have a father," she added. "And I didn't have somebody who was supposed to be in my corner. I learned last year from my aunt that my mom used to blame me. She used to say, 'How do I know she didn't want it?' Here I am today 51 years old and I don't have either parent. So I'm out here on my own and it's very hurtful but I can't let that destroy me. I feel like God has a plan for me."
It was the only time in the interview that Valenti's plain-speaking demeanor began to waver into tears, but then she instinctually took control.
Valenti had no childhood role models. No one believed in her.
"I didn't have nobody to tap me on the shoulder and say 'hey little girl, what's going on? Why are you doing these things?'" She recalled. "So now, I am very passionate when people tell me things are happening with their daughters, sons, nieces or nephews. I understand that. I heard somebody say on a panel one time that 'crazy wasn't born crazy. Something happened to crazy when crazy was a baby to make crazy, crazy.' Something happens in the home that drives people to the streets. When you understand that, you have a choice to change your life."
Valenti credits being a lesbian as key to changing hers.
"I was a gang member," she said. "I was 17 and hanging out on a corner at Lawrence and Clark and there was a building across the street with two people I am still friends with today. I knew they were gay. One of them came up to me and was like 'hey, you like girls don't you?' I was like 'no!' But we became friends and I started meeting different people. Once I realized it was OK to be a lesbian and that there were women [like] me, I liked that better than gangbanging so, little-by-little, I left that life."
Valenti's first partner was a woman 10 years her senior who had four kids.
"I got a job at Osco Drug and worked my way up from a clerk to store supervisor and then liquor manager," she said. "I was there for 13 years. But I didn't feel like it was where I wanted be."
She got into truck driving and delivery for the Chicago-based Jays Foods and went on to become an independent contractor for the pretzel maker Snyders-Lance.
"I had my own truck, I had a route, I was making the most money I ever made in my life and I didn't have to answer to anybody," she recalled. "Then they came along and said, 'Now you've gotta buy your own route.' Mine was $66,000."
Valenti left the company. She and other employees filed a class-action lawsuit against it.
"I lived off the lawsuit," she said. "But I had this 16-foot box truck that I was trying to sell. The alternator went out. So I had it parked next to the Jewel on Ashland and Clark. One day, I get there and the truck is gone. Somebody who had the same kind of truck was moving equipment and he wiped my whole truck out. But it worked out for me because the insurance paid way more than what I was asking for it so I was able to do the kind of work I'm doing today full-time. I believe it was God's way of kicking me in the backside and pushing me out there."
She began domestic violence training at Chicago Battered Metropolitan Women's Network. There, Valenti met representatives from Rape Victims Advocates (RVA) and started working on their courses.
"When I took the domestic violence training, I didn't feel like I needed it," she said. "But one thing that never crossed my mind was women with disabilities in abusive relationships. My teacher was a woman in a wheelchair who had polio. She had been in an abusive relationship for two years and she said 'my husband used to hit me wherever he felt like, mostly in my face. He would pick me up out of my chair, put me in the bathroom on the floor and lock me in there for hours at a time.' So some of this stuff I thought I knew, I didn't know at all."
In 2009, Valenti met McCormack and her partner, Siu Moy, at a fundraiser for their son. At the time, Valenti had her own nonprofit United For A Cause which worked with women and children suffering from domestic violence.
"They said they were alone and I was like, 'No you're not,'" Valenti said. "So we became friends. When Joy lost her son, she looked for help and couldn't find anybody. She looked in the yellow pages. There was nobody to help her with her grief and what she was feeling. The one person she did find said 'what do you need?' She didn't know what she needed."
When the trial of her son's killers concluded, McCormack decided to create an organization dedicated to ensuring that nobody would have to walk the same journey alone. Each of the founders had jobs for at a least year before Chicago Survivors had enough funding for some paid positions. McCormack is not on staff, but she is chair of the board. It became a calling because the need was so great.
"How do you deal with the hospital when security is telling you to leave and they won't let you see your loved one?" Valenti said. "Or you get to the medical examiner's office and it's open between this time and this time and only two of you can go in for identification. It's stuff that nobody knows because you don't expect to bury your child. There's a lot of protocols and procedures in this city that people don't know. If their loved one is pronounced dead on the street, [the body] is taken to the medical examiner's office but you have to wait for the autopsy to be done."
At first, Chicago Survivors found their families through word-of-mouth.
"We would get calls from people who knew people or even the media sometimes," Valenti said. "Joy worked very hard on this. She wanted to see it happen. There were no groups like ours that are structured and doing the things we do."
The organization currently has 12 staff members including four crisis responders.
"I don't have a degree in pain," Valenti added.
"It is something I experienced on my own. I have a connection to the streets. So when I am visiting with family who has lost a child to violence, I feel like they would rather talk to me than talk to somebody in a suit with a briefcase."
The day before she met with Windy City Times, Valenti was with the mother of Demetrius Griffin, Jr. His body was found in a pile of trash in a burning garage in the West Side neighborhood of Austin Sept. 17. He was just 15.
"His mother was waiting on the medical examiner's office to call her because they had to wait on the dental records. She kept telling me 'I know it's my son. But we can talk about it because I feel you in my heart'." Valenti recalled. "I think that's because I'm real and I'm passionate about what I do."
Yet no matter how horrific the story or how harrowing the grief, she does not cry in front of family members.
"I don't, I don't, I don't," she repeated emphatically. "Because I have to be their strength. I can't break down. But there's times when I leave the family and I'm in my car down the street and I break down or I go home and I just shut it down. To hear a woman say 'I thought giving birth was the worst thing I had to do' after she walks out of the medical examiner's office identifying her son is hard for me. I walked into a funeral home one time and saw a casket standing upright. Never seen that before. Didn't understand why until the parents came in and I heard the mom say 'nobody will ever look down on my daughter.'"
"She was 18," Valenti added. "She had just finished [training] as a pharmacy tech. She was standing on the corner with some friends. Somebody firing at the guys on the corner shot and killed her. But that casket was upright. When I left, I got two blocks away and just broke down because I'm mad at a society that would do something like this to [a woman's] daughter and then she has to bury her but not want anybody to look down on her."
The murder rate in Chicago is such that, looking at a weekend shooting report in its local media has become akin to reading the posted names of casualties of war-just a name and maybe a short sentence about their age and where they lived.
"Years ago, when you heard about the shootings, the media used to list them as 'The first or the second Chicago public student' but I was like 'these kids have names,"" Valenti said. "You hear things like 'gang-related' but we've been working with the CPD to make them understand that, when they label things as 'gangrelated,' it affects life insurance and crime victims' compensation. Even today I was meeting with a family who were upset because a media outlet had said that their son was a convicted felon and a gang member. They said he wasn't."
As for the mainstream media and the society it serves, Valenti wants to know where the outrage is over the senseless and endless killing.
"Does society have to hear about a family who was waiting two days for dental records because their 15-year-old-son was burnt to death?" she said. "When do we stop pointing fingers? I've heard that [victims] were calling for help and nobody came. Why? If I hear you calling for help, I'm going to stop. I'm going to help you."
That is Valenti's life now and it is one that she finally calls home.

Talking with prison abolitionist Mariame Kaba

Abstract: Ever since I've known her, [Mariame Kaba]'s always been there doing that work with organizations like Broadway Youth Center and Young Women's Action Team, and has always been actively engaged in supporting and collaborating with youth around these issues. So it's not surprising that she has helped create a large cadre of people who are now doing so much radical work: she's deep rooted in their organizations.

Full text:   To anyone who knows her, prison abolitionist Mariame Kaba is a force of nature. On any given day, she might be in court in the morning, supporting a teenager facing incarceration, then leading a community discussion on the history of Black radical organizing, and then giving a presentation on young women and the juvenile justice system in the evening.
Kaba is also a prominent social media presence, mostly on Twitter where her sly, snarky and often pointed critiques of social policy around incarceration have earned her a massive following. All this has happened with very few pictures of her: She loathes being photographed, and does not part easily with photos of herself.
One night, as I prepared to drop exhausted into my own bed, I tweeted her, asking how she did it all. "Insomnia" was the answer.
Mariame Kaba moved to Chicago from her beloved native city of New York in 1995. After 21 years, and having become a fixture in the city's social justice and prison abolition movements, Kaba is now moving back to New York, leaving behind large cadres of activists actively mourning her departure. Even casual conversations with her friends and co-organisers indicate a real, palpable sense of loss.
It is easy to lionize Kaba, whose energy and dedication to the cause of prison abolition has mobilized and sustained several organizations like Project NIA, which she founded, and Chicago Freedom School, which she was instrumental in forming. She has also been involved with groups like Young Women's Empowerment Project, and several of the activists in Black Lives Matter, Black Youth Project, and Assata's Daughters, all key players in the recent overthrow of Anita Alavarez, originally began working with her when they were teenagers. Her reach and influence is long-standing and extends to many seemingly disparate parts of the city. She has also frequently served as advisor to groups like Gender JUST (with which I am involved), helping them to find resources and become and stay sustainable. Her list of accomplishments and awards is long.
But to simply focus on Kaba as an individual is to miss the larger and very queer context in which her work has come about and, in very specific ways, made possible.
When Kaba first came here, the term "prison abolition" was barely heard or even understood as a point of discussion on either the local or the national level. Today, phrases like "prison industrial complex" (PIC) and "incarceration" are used by mainstream presidential candidates like Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Even Republican candidates have begun to call for reform of the incarceration system.
But reform is not what Kaba or her fellow activists are after. What they want is full-scale abolition, the end of the prison system and the establishment of practices that take community needs into account. In practical terms: Where the conventional system might throw everyone into prison, usually for long periods or even forever, systems like Transformative and Restorative Justice (TJ and RJ) call for both perpetrators and victims to receive support as they work towards establishing a different set of priorities to achieve "justice," including forms of personal restitution.
TJ and RJ are only beginning to gain attention and while there is a lot of calling for reform, abolition itself might still be a long way away. But in the years since 1995, Chicago has become the national epicenter of a movement of resistance to the PIC and police brutality.
The Laquan McDonald shooting was only one of many flashpoints in a contentious election between then incumbent cook county state's attorney Anita Alvarez and challenger Kim Foxx. In the month leading up to the election, Alvarez was clearly slated to win. But a coalition of queer and mostly Black activists from groups like Assata's Daughters, Black Youth Project, and Black Lives Matter coordinated a stunning effort across the city. They distributed hundreds of flyers with the hashtag #ByeAnita everywhere, and achieved banner drops to drive home the point. Versions of the banner included one with the words, "Blood on the ballot."
The current push to end the PIC among mostly queer radicals did not come out of the blue.
Speaking with Windy City Times about her activist work, Kaba spoke about her early experiences in the domestic violence sector. In New York, she had been volunteering for rape crisis centers and domestic violence organizations like Sanctuary for Families. Once in Chicago, she looked for similar opportunities, and found work at Friends of Battered Women and Children (now renamed Between Friends).
"I initially thought I wanted to end genderbased violence," she said, and continued, "I felt interpersonal violence was what I wanted to work against." But as she continued her work, it dawned on her that the domestic violence sector was "mostly in the business of managing. The point was not to eradicate but manage the problem. There was no cause analysis."
As an example, she pointed to her experience in New York City: "I was the coordinator of an emergency shelters in Brooklyn. Even the rules put in place-about the time they could come in for their curfew, for instance-were all about taking away their ability to be agents of their own lives, even as we were giving people safety for the short term. But we were turning our wheels, we were very individualistic," without looking more closely at systemic problems.
Kaba's increasing discomfort and eventual resistance to such a system meant that she felt more alienated and was, as she put it with a laugh, eventually "exiled out of the traditional domestic violence/sexual assault" field.
The year 2000 saw the founding of INCITE!, an anti-PIC group out of California. INCITEi's second conference was in Chicago, in 2002, and here Kaba became a key organizer, alongside colleagues and local activists like Kristin Millikan and Prudence Browne. The event included critiques of the PIC and the domestic violence industry.
In Chicago, Kaba continued working on these issues with an expanding group of activists like Shira Hassan, Lewis Wallace, Sabrina Hampton, and Megan Selby. Black and Pink, an abolitionist group which works directly with LGBTQ prisoners, founded a chapter in the city.
Kaba was also constantly organizing teaching collectives, where people would gather to read and understand the history of Black radical organizing, the kind of work done mostly by Black women and which remains relatively unacknowledged (many of the resources can be found on her blog Prison Culture). Page May, who would go on to become a leading figure in the #ByeAnita campaign and a co-founder of Assata's Daughters, first met Kaba during one such collective.
Windy City Times asked Kaba what might have attracted so many queer people to her work. She pointed out that such work had already been happening, with groups like Queer to the Left, Women and Girls Collective, and Gender JUST. All these critiqued the expansion of the PIC in different ways, even if not under the rubric of prison abolition. But, she added, "Queerness is also a way in which you are marginalized and have to reshape your identity," and the work around prison abolition calls forth people who understand the damage the PIC does to individuals and groups.
There's also a historical connection, in terms of direct action, something that queers engaged in relentlessly during the height of the AIDS crisis. Kaba pointed out that, "Direct action is more accepted in this generation; blockades and banner drops make sense to them."
Those who have worked with Kaba attest to her ability to not just organize but create extensive and effective networks of support. Hannah Baptiste, a member of Assata's Daughters recalled meeting Kaba four years ago, after moving here from Washingon D.C: "I had the impression that organizing in radical communities was about creating Community with a capital C, that everyone had to be friends with each other to make anything happen. But here in Chicago, with Mariame at the helm, organizing was based in being accountable to each other in terms of the lenses of the issues, rather than friendship. It was important to see a black woman who was undoubtedly leading so much of the organizing force but not through a cult of personality, which often looks like vying for attention."
As for why so many queers were attracted to the work, Baptiste said that "Mariame laid this amazing groundwork that allowed folks to come into their own, with queer or radical politics, in a way that helps other folks deepen and broaden their analysis. Organizing around prison abolition and queer organizing work are rooted in the same creative impetus to radically reimagine a different way of doing things. It's a world with queer radical sensibilities, and Mariame made space for everyone, wherever they're at."
Ann Russo, associate professor in women and gender studies at DePaul concurred on the matter of Kaba's ability to bring a range of people into organizing. The two first met in 2004, in the context of domestic violence and sexual assault organizing, around the time both were becoming disillusioned about the nature of that work.
"Ever since I've known her, Mariame's always been there doing that work with organizations like Broadway Youth Center and Young Women's Action Team, and has always been actively engaged in supporting and collaborating with youth around these issues. So it's not surprising that she has helped create a large cadre of people who are now doing so much radical work: she's deep rooted in their organizations. In terms of queer folks she is always someone who didn't care what people thought, and was always challenging homophobia and transphobia.''
Given her key role in Chicago organizing, what happens when Kaba finally moves away in mid-May? Russo says that the work will continue precisely because her model has been to demonstrate how to organize for maximum impact: "She doesn't take over what she asks you to do, she just expects you to do it. She's always challenging the idea that 'no one is doing it.' Instead, she just asks, how do we do this; it's about the creation of resources and a focus on strategies."
Baptiste is similarly optimistic: "I think that the place that Chicago is in right now, is one with very strong robust networks, because Mariame has been in Chicago for 20-30 years and she has set those networks in motion. We will be just fine, if a little sadder."

Abstract: "What seems to be one thing in the distance is very different close-up," [Steinern] quoted. "I tell you this story because it's the kind of lesson that can only be learned on the road. And also because I've come to believe that, inside, each of us has a purple motorcycle. We only have to discover it and ride."

Full text:   Two generations of feminism represented in celebrated activist Gloria Steinern alongside author and Purdue University professor Roxane Gay met on Oct. 29 before a capacity crowd at The People's Church on Chicago's North Side.
Andersonville-based bookstore Women and Children First hosted the conversation and book-signing of Steinem's new work, My Life on the Road, and Gay's Bad Feminist.
In setting a theme of continuity, Women and Children First founder and former owner Linda Bubon and current co-owner and former employee Sarah Hollenbeck introduced Steinern and Gay to a lengthy standing ovation.
"It is deeply satisfying to be standing here with two such renowned feminists," Bubon said. "And all of the beautiful feminists out there, young and old, who were with us despite many ups and downs and the terrible Bush years. Feminism is stronger now and more widespread than ever before. Our work is not done but we are here tonight to celebrate how far we've come and to honor the legacy of the woman who has stood for all of us."
"I've never met Roxane and I wanted to meet the future," Steinern said before reading the prelude of her book, which recalled a visit to the Sturgis, South Dakota, motorcycle rally and her preconceptions, which changed particularly when she encountered a grandmother who proudly owned a purple Harley.
"What seems to be one thing in the distance is very different close-up," Steinern quoted. "I tell you this story because it's the kind of lesson that can only be learned on the road. And also because I've come to believe that, inside, each of us has a purple motorcycle. We only have to discover it and ride."
In an essay from Bad Feminist, Gay challenged her own preconceptions. "At some point, I got it into my head that a feminist was a certain kind of woman. I bought into grossly inaccurate myths about who feminists aremilitant, perfect in their politics and person, man-hating, humorless," she read. "I bought into these myths even though, intellectually, I know better. I'm not proud of this. I don't want to buy into these myths anymore."
Steinern and Gay engaged in a lively conversation between themselves and the audience, which covered a range of topics including overcoming self-doubt, women's health and control of reproduction in a male-dominated society, changes in women's activism over the years and their opinions of the 2016 elections.
"We see movements as political silos," Steinern noted. "Movements are all connected and part of the national agenda. We talk about economic stimulus but the single biggest economic stimulus would be equal pay for women of all races. We have to get this out there. It would put $400 billion into the economy every year."
"The biggest predictor of violence is domestic violence," Steinern added while noting the history of domestic violence displayed by George Zimmerman prior to shooting Trayvon Martin in 2012. "It wasn't even admissible as evidence during his trial. If we understood this linkage, who knows, Trayvon Martin might be alive if Zimmerman had been taken out of commission."
Both Gay and Steinern enthusiastically supported Hillary Clinton's campaign bid.
"She's the best of our options," Gay said, "just looking at her experience alone. I thought she held up really well during the Benghazi hearings."
As far as Clinton's potential Republican opponents, after watching their performance during the Oct. 28 CNBC debate, Gay characterized them as "10 people who are failures in many different ways. Every single one of them, as a candidate, frightens me."
"As someone who comes from New York, I feel somewhat responsible for Donald Trump," Steinern added. "He's gone bankrupt four times and stuck everybody with his debt. It's unspeakable to me."
Steinern asserted that women needed to organize and take over the Republican Party: "We need to think big here. They are too dangerous."

Full text:   The internecine battles of the gay community are legendary. They are not limited to Chicago, or to any one segment of the community. And the gay media have certainly not been immune to these growing pains of the fledgling modern gay-rights movement (more recently called the LGBTQ movement).
Chicago's gay media have strong and deep roots. In Chicago, Henry Gerber started what is believed to be the first U.S. gay publication in the 1920s. Friendship and Freedom lasted just two issues, thanks to harassment by the postal service and police, but Gerber's work did not go unnoticed. And his courage still inspires Chicago journalists.
In the 1950s, Chuck Renslow and Dorn Orejudos started the men's physique magazines Triumph, Mars and Rawhide Male. In the 1960s, the Mattachine Midwest Newsletter was a vital source for community news and information, including reports on police harassment, mainstream media bias-and the 1969 Stonewall protests in New York.
Soon more radical gay publications sprang up, including newsletters and tabloid newspapers. Most of the 1970s publications were allvolunteer, but by the end of the decade more business people got involved and tried to professionalize gay media with salaries and pay for freelance stories, photography and delivery drivers. The local newspapers Chicago Gay Crusader and GayLife even added newspaper distribution boxes on the streets in the 1970s.
By 1984, GayLife and Gay Chicago were the two primary gay publications that survived the 1970s publishing startup frenzy. Gay Chicago was a magazine, focused mainly on what was happening in the bar and entertainment world. GayLife was a serious newspaper with coverage of news locally, nationally and internationally, plus entertainment, sports and features.
But by 1985, GayLife was being criticized as part of the old guard, and its publisher, Chuck Renslow, was especially under fire. Renslow was politically active and an owner of multiple businesses-the newspaper, bars and a bathhouse (at a time when AIDS was just beginning to strike hard in Chicago). He led the local Democratic gay organization and had run to become a convention delegate for U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy's presidential campaign in 1980. People were concerned that he had unfair influence over the community through the newspaper. I started working for Renslow in June 1984 and never saw a misuse of power, but in our community, perception becomes reality.
Sales manager Bob Bearden and his partner, Jeff McCourt, a part-time writer for the paper (under the pseudonym Mimi O'Shea), were making a move to buy GayLife the summer of 1985. But instead they went behind Renslow's back and decided to start their own paper, Windy City Times. Bearden, McCourt and Drew Badanish, from the art department, all lobbied me intensely to come with them. They each put in $10,000 to start WCT. I had been the managing editor of GayLife and would keep that post at the new paper. But I was just 22 years old. I didn't have the negative experience to lead me to a decision to abandon ship. After some soul-searching, and trusting in Bearden, I made the difficult decision to be part of the new company.
We launched Windy City Times on Sept. 26, 1985. To say we started on a shoestring would be an understatement. While McCourt boasted of making a lot of money as a Chicago Board Options Exchange trader, the truth was that it was just bluster, at least by the time WCT started. And Renslow fought against Windy City Times for several months in the courts. I was forced to do a deposition and left the lawyer's office a wreck. Nothing ever came of the lawsuit, but it was a drain on emotion, time and resources.
We worked out of Jeff and Bob's apartment on Melrose Street just west of Lake Shore Drive, a third-floor walk-up. There were images of naked guys in the bathroom-blatant sexual images I had to get used to at GayLife and at many subsequent gay newspaper offices. We originally did typesetting at a downtown firm, Tangible Type, owned by Chris Cothran and Sarah Craig. (Craig died in 1994; Cothran, in 1996.)
After McCourt's passing in 2007, Chicago magazine published an article about his death and noted: "Looked at today, the first issue [of Windy City Times] seems inadvertently portentous. The front page has three stories, one on Mayor Harold Washington assembling a 15-person committee on gay and lesbian issues-a first for Chicago-and two on a subject that would dominate gay life and politics for the next decade: the AIDS epidemic."
It was a struggle psychologically and emotionally, not to mention physically and financially. While GayLife staggered and then folded within a few months after our start, leaving us with no direct competition, it was still not easy trying to do a gay newspaper in 1985. Bob got sick within a few weeks, eventually learning it was AIDS. He became a hermit, and my girlfriend at the time, a nurse's assistant, helped him.
Jeff put pressure on Bob because the paper needed his talents to sell ads. Bob just could not. He struggled out that Halloween, just four weeks after the paper launched, to take bar photos and work his accounts. But Bob could not deal with his diagnosis. His friends were dying, his partner was pressuring, and a newspaper was being run out of his home. We would be working late hours and hated to be in the way when Bob would shuffle out of his room to the kitchen-where we were pasting up the art boards.
In the spring of 1986 we moved to a separate office at 3225 N. Sheffield Ave., behind Gay Horizons (which now exists in another location as Center on Halsted), in the Rodde Center, the gay community center of that day. Our offices were next to the el train, so we paced our phone calls between those noisy neighbors. By the time Bob died in January 1987, the office dynamics had deteriorated.
Many people stepped up to help-freezing with the typesetting machines, writing articles and helping our reputation in the community. But I felt I was letting them down-Jeff and I were having power struggles. Jeff had no journalism background-he had only written gossip and entertainment prior to starting the paper-and I was very young.
Jeff had promised a hands-off approach to the news side, but he soon realized that was where his community power could come. He started writing editorials, including political ones. He and I came to a difficult decision in the 1987 aldermanic campaign when openly gay Dr. Ron Sable first challenged 44th Ward Aid. Bernie Hansen. Jeff wrote an editorial endorsing Hansen, and I did one for Sable. He started fuming about silly things like photo layouts, while people were not getting paid and didn't have insurance. I, for one, went a six-month stretch with no paycheck.
When an attacker came into the office with a bat one day, he asked for and went after Jeff directly, causing injury to one arm. No one else was hurt, but it was played by Jeff as a hate crime. (He testified in Springfield, Illinois, about the attack as part of a push for gay legislation). There were many ugly rumors, including some about drugs. The police calmed our staff down by hinting that it was not a general attack but probably drug-connected. The truth never came out, but it also made it difficult for all of us. When I left a few months later, one of Jeff's loyal allies even spread a rumor that I had hired a hit man to target Jeff!
With Bob gone, and with Drew Badanish bought out by Jeff, I had decided enough was enough. Not only was the office too stressful, but some of us now worried for our lives as well.
I started looking for investors to buy Jeff out. Jeff had indicated he was burned out and depressed, so it seemed like a good idea at the time. We made an offer through an attorney, but when Jeff found out I was behind the deal, he was furious. Sales Manager Jill Bürgin had to step between us for fear something might happen. I wanted to walk out right then, because I was ready to start a new paper, and most of the dozen or so full-time staff were coming with me. But several of the staffers, including reporter Bill Burks, convinced me the right thing to do was stay and put out two more editions of the weekly Windy City Times. I agreed, as long as Jeff stayed away from me. (We were on separate floors at this point.)
After those two weeks, we moved full force into starting Outlines, in the In These Times office building at 1300 W. Belmont Ave.
As Chicago magazine noted in September 2007: "McCourt also enjoyed a good fight. When Tracy Bairn left to found her own publication, Outlines, five months after Bob Bearden's death, she touched off what will probably go down in history as Chicago's last great newspaper war."
Even though I was the same gender as before, the fact that I was a woman with her name on "top" of the masthead made it easy for Jeff to really play the gender card. He successfully influenced advertisers away from Outlines, saying it was "just" a lesbian paper. He said I hated men, even though most of the people who left his employ to start Outlines were men. But just as with GayLife's demise, perception is reality. Outlines always struggled with the gender issue and advertising. If getting ads in a gay paper was hard in the 1980s and 1990s, getting ads in a paper stereotyped as lesbian was even harder. But our reader statistics always showed a balance of around 60 percent male and 40 percent female. A typical gay newspaper at the time was 90 percent male.
Windy City Times and Outlines went headto-head as weeklies for a few months, but by February 1988 I knew we could not keep up with the bills or get more investment money, so we went to a monthly newspaper format for the next nine years. The Reader declared Jeff the victor.
Jeff was really motivated. Albert Williams, who had worked at GayLife, was interim editor after I left. The paper was very active in pushing for the city gay-rights bill, taking a strong advocacy approach to the battle.
Jeff soon hired a young gun, Mark Schoofs, as editor, and he took the paper to another level. Mark (who won a Pulitzer Prize for AIDS reporting for The Village Voice after he left WCT) had a great team of both experienced and newer journalists putting out an awardwinning weekly newspaper. Subsequent managing editors kept that pace going. Several times, WCT won a Peter Lisagor Award, a prominent Chicago journalism honor. The competition helped both papers, but being a weekly with a stronger economic base had many advantages.
WCT became one of the top gay newspapers in the country. Jeff was especially brilliant at getting mainstream businesses to advertise, which is what helped his paper grow in size. He was very much about size, and proudest of his ever-growing Pride editions of WCT. But Jeff also alienated a lot of people and was just as erratic and drug-influenced as he had been when I worked for him. Eventually, those internal demons would catch up to him, but for more than a decade he thrived-on the competition, the journalism and the business.
Jeff also got very involved politically, and WCT endorsed candidates at almost every level of office. While I was criticized for working on sports (I was co-vice chair of the Gay Games when they came to Chicago) and business (I founded the Chicago Area Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce in 1995), Jeff had his hands in politics and entertainment. He tried to influence elections and lobbying efforts, he produced plays, and he was briefly president of a theater company. Jeff also was part of the National Gay Newspaper Guild to increase the clout of regional gay media. Those moves had their own conflicts of interest, but often publishers (of papers large and small) can't avoid all connections to the community.
Windy City Times also lobbied successfully along with 46th Ward Aid. Helen Shiller for increased AIDS funding under Mayor Richard M. Daley.
Jeff's Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame biography states: "While maintaining Windy City Times as an independent voice, he embraced advocacy journalism and supported activism aimed at winning mainstream respect and political victories for Chicago's LGBT communities. During the 1986-88 stages of a long campaign to pass a Chicago human rights ordinance that would prohibit sexual-orientation discrimination, the newspaper's offices were known as 'Ordinance Central' because of McCourt's generosity in allowing activists to use space and equipment. The paper's editorials galvanized community and political support for the ordinance after initial defeats."
Mark Schoofs was quoted in Chicago magazine after Jeff died: "I wonder if Jeff was one of the last of the spectacularly self-destructive gay men. He was definitely a gay publishing visionary. The gay community was coming into its own in those years, and Jeff was one of the people who recognized that gays were part of mainstream America. He understood that gays were like Jews and blacks and Puerto Ricans and Irish people-another tile in the mosaic of America. He was incredibly flawed to the extent that he himself could not be part of that mainstream. But he was one of the people who made it happen."
Chicago also noted that WCT "benefited from the government deregulation of the telecommunications industry in the late 1980s, which, among other inadvertent side effects, spurred the development of the telephone sex industry-the ubiquitous 900 sex numbers of the era. The back pages of many lifestyle publications-including Windy City Times-were flooded with full-page come-hither ads for those services." Former WCT salesman Steve Alter told Chicago: "It was like money that dropped out of the sky. Suddenly what was a $300,000- or $400,000-a-year paper became an $800,000-a-year paper." With the money came a high-flying lifestyle.
Jeff's WCT featured award-winning columnists, including Jon-Henri Damski and Achy Obejas, who provided in-depth analysis of politics and the community. (Obejas shared in a Pulitzer Prize after leaving WCT.) ACT UP's Danny Sotomayor had been fired by Gay Chicago, and soon his controversial editorial cartoons were in WCT. But Jeff fired both Jon-Henri and Danny, and both immediately migrated to Outlines/Nightlines before they passed away (Danny in 1992 and Jon-Henri in 1997). Jeff suffered many similar losses of talented people; he attracted some of the best but, after a few years, most moved on. This was not a problem WCT alone faced; most gay media have a high turnover because journalists are now finally welcomed more into mainstream careers that can offer higher wages and often more respect-thanks in large part to the work of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.
"If McCourt had no problem attracting top talent, however, retaining it was another story," Chicago magazine's 2007 story noted. "Four years seems to have been the limit for most people. Some left for better jobs, but most simply were burned out from dealing with a person who-for all of his intelligence and drive-seemed at times completely oblivious of the impact of his actions on people." And the abuse of drugs only got worse. Steve Alter related Jeff's arrest for cocaine possession, which included a brief stint in Cook County Jail, in a post on the Reader website after Jeff died.
Louis Weisberg was editor of Windy City Times for five years until he was among those who left to start another competing paper in 1999. He told Chicago magazine: "We'd have editorial meetings where Jeff would be sitting there with white powder around his nose, drinking booze out of a bottle with Ryan Idol asleep on the couch. At some point we just knew this wasn't going to work-that this was no way to run a business." Jeff had a relationship with the porn star Ryan Idol that was complicated and at times disturbing to Jeff's friends and employees. (Idol's real name was Marc Anthony Donáis. In 2012 he was sentenced to 12 years in prison for attempted murder of his ex-girlfriend in 2009.)
Meanwhile, I was always trying something new to keep Outlines alive. I never did drugs or drank alcohol, but I was certainly a workaholic. We had started a weekly bar rag called Nightlines in 1990, which kept us covering news alongside bar photos. (It became Nightspots in the early 2000s, and folded into WCT in 2015). Rex Wockner was our full-time reporter for several years; he helped to keep Outlines and Nightlines on the journalism map-and he eventually became the most widely syndicated gay media reporter in the world. We had an amazing team of dedicated employees and freelancers, and we, too, won awards for our journalism and work in the community.
We also started BLACKlines and En La Vida, monthly newspapers for the African-American and Latino LGBT communities; both began in 1995, and they ran about 10 years each. Our website for Outlines started in 1996. (Jeff never owned the domain name WindyCityTimes. com, and later we had to fight in an international tribunal to get it back from one of Jeff's former employees.) We were trying to fill different media needs and niches, staying afloat with the generous support of community investors including Nan Schaffer and Scott McCausland. They were our angels in those early years, and Nan and so many others have remained supportive, even as we added Windy City Radio after buying the old LesBiGay Radio.
Windy City Times was a formidable opponent, and the staff kept it going despite both internal and external obstacles. This is why it was a truly unique set of circumstances that led Outlines, the much smaller company, to purchase Windy City Times in 2000-a Davidand-Goliath story.
Newspaper War, Part 2
By 1997, Outlines seemed strong enough to make the change back to a weekly newspaper, so we took the plunge, something which, in retrospect, probably strengthened us for the battles ahead.
In the summer of 1999, Jeff McCourt suffered another walkout, as reported earlier in this chapter, but this time the way it happened (with no notice) somehow hit him so hard that he rebounded all the way back to me-he called me for the first time in 13 years, and we commiserated about the way they left him. I sympathized with him, but never underestimated the road ahead. Jeff was not giving up yet.
The exodus had been planned for a long time. Before they started their Chicago Free Press, some of the new venture's investors even met with me at Outlines-I, of course, didn't know they were starting a paper, and that they had just been fishing for business information from me, claiming to be interested in buying ads. The WCT staff took their last paychecks and left right before finishing the second-most-important edition of the paper (coinciding with Northalsted Market Days). Some staff remained, but the company was in deep trouble.
Jeff was left far more vulnerable after this staff defection than when I left, for a few reasons. First, when I had started Outlines, I did not have the type of deep pockets supporting us as the new CFP had. I was able to get friends and community members to buy shares in my company, and they trusted me to run it. (Some people believe I am an heiress to a nonexistent Clarence Darrow fortune, which is not true; my mom was a distant relative to Darrow, and my parents were very middle-class. All I received from them in starting Outlines was a $1,000 check from my stepdad, Steve Pratt, and my mother's help in typing articles-plus their fantastic emotional and moral support, which I believe is priceless and the most valuable thing they could have given me.)
Second, our original goal had been to buy Windy City Times, so starting a new paper was not ideal in 1987. By 1999, when CFP started, the gay market was larger and more appealing to mainstream investors and advertisers, which helped CFP. Third, Jeff himself was not nearly as strong as he had been in 1987, so he had a difficult time battling the new opponent. Fourth, it couldn't have been easy for him to have suffered a second and more debilitating staff walkout.
Fifth, the employees left Jeff right in the middle of a deadline, which meant Jeff could not recover quickly; when we left for Outlines, we gave Jeff two weeks' notice and did put out two more painful issues. Sixth, the top people leaving WCT for CFP were mostly men, and I have to say that this was an advantage in the marketplace. When I left, it was also mostly male staff who came with me (because the staff was mostly male), which meant, of course, that it was mostly men who founded Outlines. But with me "on top" and a few other strong women in positions of authority, we were stereotyped from the start by Jeff. CFP did not have that strike against them. Seventh, I was only 24 when I left to start Outlines and did not have as much experience; most of those who left to start CFP were much older and had been around the business far longer.
And finally, while Jeff did continue to publish for another year, he spent huge financial and emotional capital fighting the former staff that had gone to CFP. Jeff never sued me or Outlines, so his energy and money were not diverted into such a fight earlier.
Dan Page, former production manager and art director of Windy City Times, wrote a scathing rebuke of those who walked out to form CFP, in a posting on the Reader's blog after Jeff died in 2007. Dan had worked during the buildup to the walkout and had been privy to some of the plans, but he was not among the defectors. "The timing of the mutiny was planned to CRIPPLE Jeff (in every sense)," Page wrote. "They had hoped to buy the publication at fire- sale prices, and, if not, to destroy it. ... Jeff was out of town the weekend of the mutiny because two staffers, a couple, who were among the Free Press founders, had encouraged him to go to his Michigan summer house. ..."
In fact, Jeff learned about the defection from a journalist: Mike Miner at the Reader called him to ask about the mass resignations. "The reason I found myself breaking the bad news to McCourt is that he wasn't supposed to know it yet," Miner wrote in the Reader of Aug. 5, 1999.
So, departing staff and freelancers started Chicago Free Press and battled McCourt's Windy City Times for a year-both in the courts and for advertisers. Outlines just chugged along for that year, trying to dodge the bullets and stay away from a circulation and advertising-rate war. But because Outlines had gone back to a weekly schedule, it really helped us compete. It also positioned us well for what happened next.
While WCT staffers-including Dan Page, Karen Hawkins, Neda Ulaby, Aaron Anderson, Mark Bazant, Tony Peregrin, Gary Barlow and others-worked hard to keep the paper going, the fight drained Jeff so that even when the court case ended, and even though he reportedly won, he had lost the final battle. He was forced to close the paper in August 2000 (the last issue was in July), and I called him immediately to buy it. He agreed, and after a few weeks of negotiations, Outlines' parent company, Lambda Publications, purchased just the name of the paper and changed the corporation name to Windy City Media Group. There were no other assets, not even any archives, just a lot of bad will among advertisers, some staff and parts of the community.
Jeff almost changed his mind about the sale-but his lawyers knew better (no one else expressed serious interest, and certainly not for the price we offered), and they walked him through the sale until the final signature was completed. I was able to get new investors, but the rest of the money came from putting my home on the line for a loan from the bank.
Many people said I was crazy, but I do believe had we not purchased the brand of Windy City Times, Outlines was going to be killed by the competition at Chicago Free Press, which had deep pockets and a laser focus on market dominance. As part of the purchase, we also eventually got WCT's seat on the National Gay Newspaper Guild, something that was highly coveted since only one paper per market was allowed membership.
Jeff and I met at my bank on the sale day in the fall of 2000. He and I sat outside of South Shore Bank, reminiscing about the old days. How hard it was-how it actually never got much easier. About people we had lost, about Bob, about their old three-story walkup apartment on Melrose. It was surreal, acting like old friends, when we had fought tooth-and-nail for 13 years. But sometimes that phrase "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" comes true-Jeff had been so wounded that he actually turned back to me as an ally. Jeff was chain-smoking and looked very frail. He had the shakes and looked far older than he should have. I honestly don't know how he survived another seven years after that day, dying in 2007 at age 51-one year younger than I am today.
The buyout of the Windy City Times name was important for Outlines, because it gave us a mainstream recognition to face the continual media wars in Chicago. Some in the community did not support us, because they viewed it as helping Jeff get out of debt. But I tried to see the value to the community, and to our business, and in the end it was the right decision.
We merged the two weeklies into one Windy City Times in September 2000, and I felt as if I had got my baby back after it had been in foster care.
As for Jeff, his last years were lonely and painful. Mike Miner, in his Reader obituary May 7, 2007, wrote: "McCourt had one friend at the end, possibly the only one who knew about his death when it happened. Gregory Munson says he was hired seven years ago by McCourt's sister, Diane, his legal guardian, to be his 'chaperone.' At the time Munson was working for an agency, Always Caring. 'He had gotten mugged when he was staying in the Talbot Hotel,' Munson told me. 'To my understanding, they found him in an alley unconscious and he went into Northwestern Hospital in a coma.' When McCourt was transferred to a nursing home, Munson went to work for him. 1 was originally with him five days a week,' he says. 'As time went by, it dwindled down to two hours once a month. [His sister] said he was broke. He disputed that but he was afraid to go to court to fight. He just hated that he couldn't have more control over his own life.'"
Jeff's brother, Dan McCourt, said that, at the end, Jeff had nothing left; and it's true that Jeff got very little from the sale of his paper. He had almost $400,000 in debts (the 1RS, his printer and his lawyers), so the sale cleared his name-but left him with little remaining.
Of course, the battles were not over. CFP continued to go after the new WCT, and a new rivalry was begun. CFP did change ownership in the mid-2000s, and eventually it was closed in May 2010. Meanwhile, Gay Chicago, which had been Chicago's oldest surviving gay publication, itself went through internal struggles and closed in September 2011.
The Next Generation
Once the two papers merged, Windy City Times continued covering LGBT news, politics, entertainment and more. Outlines had a strong team to move to WCT and retained some of the WCT staffers who had remained, in particular Karen Hawkins as news reporter, Marco Fernandez as sales representative, and Tony Peregrin, Jonathan Abarbanel, Mary Shen Barnidge and other well-known freelancers.
Politics continued to be a strong coverage area, with so many local, county, state and national elections happening almost every year. Outlines had had a policy of not endorsing candidates, so now the new Windy City Times also stayed away from such endorsements. Instead, the paper gave surveys to candidates in all races and rated them based on their responses. In the 2008 race for president, this proved important, because a 1996 Outlines survey for the state Senate, completed at that time by candidate Barack Obama, had shown he was fully supportive of same-sex marriage well before his later races for federal office.
AIDS also continued to be an important story for WCT and the community. In 2011, which marked the 30th anniversary of the epidemic's first diagnosed cases, WCT started a 13-month series on its impact. The series won a Peter Lisagor Award. It was also a finalist for a national Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation award, losing to The Boston Globe.
Other stories important during that time included the growth in the transgender-rights movement, the alarming increase in reported LGBT youth suicides, the fight to repeal the military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" gay ban, and the ongoing battle for the equal right to marriage.
But sometimes even simple business profiles can have a profound impact. A few years ago, when Chicago's Women & Children First bookstore was struggling, its owners allowed Windy City Times to tell their story in a front-page article. The store has been a key player in the Chicago LGBT community since 1979, and we knew our readers would want to know if it was at risk of closing. As soon as the article came out, thousands of dollars in donations poured in, and numerous other media picked up the story. The store is still in business, and was sold to new feminist owners. WCT has also done stories about family members and partners looking for donations to help cover funeral costs for loved ones, and the community steps up each time to help out.
Looking Back, Looking Forward
Jeff McCourt died of AIDS complications at age 51 in 2007. Soon after, I nominated him for the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame- he was inducted later that year. Few people are neutral on Jeff's legacy. Even those who left his employ have mixed feelings, about his mood swings, his drug use, his highs and his lows, his manic behavior and passionate loyalty-and his fierce competitiveness.
The bitterness caused by these wrenching gay newspaper schisms still has fallout today, but most of it is very much insider baseball, only relevant to a few folks who care about the why and how of the gay newspaper world.
Of course, if I were to do it over again, I would change many things. I am glad I helped start Windy City Times, but I would have gotten more of the deal in writing. Mostly, I would have tried to be a better boss. When I would go sometimes three or four days with no sleep, never going home, I had difficulty trying to run a business and be an editor and reporter all at the same time. Taking photos at a sports league in the morning, at a leather bar at midnight, going back to the office to write an editorial, and then trying to balance the books for payroll-that was just plain difficult. But in truth, I had much help in keeping it all afloat.
There have been many key players at Windy City Times and Outlines over the years. I hesitate to even start listing them all. And because I separated from WCT for 13 years, I did not work closely with many of the key middle-years employees. There were hundreds of people, including delivery drivers, photographers, salespeople, reporters, business staff, editors, interns, and the supportive investors and advisers.
Some of our longest-term full-time employees still with us today are Assistant Publisher Terri Klinsky, Director of New Media Jean Albright, Art Director Kirk Williamson, Managing Editor Andrew Davis, Senior Sales Rep Amy Matheny, all with us more than 14 years, and our website host Martie Marro of Love Your Website, our web expert for 20 years.
There have also been some important people present from the very first issue of WCT, still helping today in some fashion. They include Toni Armstrong Jr., Jorjet Harper and Yvonne Zipter. Many started in the late 1980s and lasted for years, including Rex Wockner, Jonathan Abarbanel and longtime writer Marie J. Kuda. And there were hundreds more, including those who continue to play important roles as we publish a daily online website and a weekly publication, Windy City Times weekly. Everyone on our masthead plays a key role.
There is one iconic picture from the early Windy City Times era that features some of the first players at WCT, some who soon left to start Outlines, and some who stayed on for many years with Jeff. Pictured in that photo, with Jeff and me, were Larry Shell, Ben Dreyer, Bill Burks, M.J. Murphy, Chris Stryker, Hugh Johnson, Steve Alter, Shani, Jorjet Harper, Larry Bommer, Yvonne Zipter, Albert Williams, Chris Cothran, Jill Bürgin, Jon-Henri Damski and Mel Wilson. It captures a brief moment in time, and brings back all the good and bad memories that were the glue holding WCT together in those formative 1980s.
We have also had to say goodbye to far too many young colleagues, most because of AIDS, some because of cancer and other tragedies: Jeff McCourt, Bob Bearden, Richard Cash, Bob Kraus, Mike Simanowicz, John Schmid, JonHenri Damski, Danny Sotomayor, Paul Adams, Joseph Beam, Tony Hassan, Marvin Patterson, Alfredo Gonzalez, Fernando Flores, Sarah Craig, GayBoy Ric, Chris Cothran, Kathleen O'Malley, John Pennycuff, William B. Kelley, our attorney Mary York, my mom and stepdad, and unfortunately the list goes on.
Next Up
There is a delicate tightrope we continue to walk, as a community-based paper that covers the good, the bad and the mixed of the LGBT movement. That means scandals at health clinics, drug arrests of leaders, domestic violence and financial mismanagement-at the same time promoting benefits and events, activists and organizations.
Windy City Times is also going through transitions similar to those of other gay and mainstream media companies. With more than 30,000 articles and 100,000-plus photos archived online, the website is a key growth area for the company. And, of course, we participate in social media, content sharing and other opportunities to build audience.
We were never intimidated by "giving it away" for free online, since our papers were always free. The dilemma is on the revenue side-who pays for all that free content. Our solution is not to charge for online contentvery few papers will survive on that model. Rather, we have to find other unique revenue streams, and that includes successful community-based events.
While online expansion is important, the primary strength of the company is still in its weekly print edition.
As part of an effort to streamline costs, the company went to a "virtual" office in 2008, just two months before the U.S. economy collapsed. This planned move made sense for a company that has most of its reporters and sales representatives in the field every day. It was an efficiency move that has actually strengthened the company to its best position in many years.
Given the closing of so many gay print publications over the past decade, Windy City Times (one of only 11 weekly LGBT newspapers left, and a member of the new National Gay Media Association) is fortunate to still be able to serve the Chicago-area LGBT community.
We benefited from an odd mix of luck, good timing, amazing support and wonderful staff. It was a unique blend, but it has worked very well. We thank the community for standing by us these 30 years, and we hope to "deliver" the news for a long time to come.
The 30th anniversary party for Windy City Times is open to the public. It will be Sunday, Sept. 27, 2-5 p.m. at Sidetrack, 3349 N. Halsted, $30 donation at the door. We will have music, a walk down memory lane, and some fun door prizes.

Abstract: In the 1970s and '80s, computers didn't have the power to search everything," he said. "We had to narrow the search down as much as we could and so we used sex, race or sometimes year-of-birth as a filter so that we weren't looking for a needle in the biggest haystack. Race was always something that could be subjective. How was it designated in the database? When you didn't know that, there was a chance that you would miss it in the search.

Full text:   Even as people were gathering in at least 20 cities across the United States for the Aug. 25 Trans Liberation Tuesday event to stand-up for and acknowledge the then-18 transgender women murdered in 2015, news stories began to break about an Aurora, Illinois, woman named Keyshia Blige.
She had been shot while driving through Aurora's South Side and died at the scene.
Blige became the 19th victim.
But the incident had not occurred earlier in the day, over the prior weekend or even during the month of August.
Blige was killed in the early hours of March 7. A statement from the Aurora Police Department reached WGN news which reported the incident that afternoon. The Aurora Beacon News-part of the Chicago Tribune Media Group-followed with a more detailed article March 24.
The Aurora Police Department as well as WGN and The Beacon News referred to Blige as a male and used her birth name. The Beacon News noted in its report that Blige had recently begun transitioning.
It was five months later, on Aug. 23, when Elizabeth Marie Rivera-the creator of the Trans Social Butterfly Networkcorrected both the Aurora PD and The Beacon News in a Facebook post.
Outrage followed as it became clear that Blige had been revictimized due to the failure of both the Aurora PD and the media to correctly report her gender and her name.
Hers was not a case in isolation.
Blige, India Clarke, Ty Underwood, Penny Proud and Jasmine Collins represent just five of the women incorrectly identified by police investigators in 2015 and subsequently by both local and national press outlets.
Lisa Gilmore is a member of the governance committee of the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) and the principal and founder of the Illinois Accountability Initiative-a statewide project responding to LGBTQ experiences of violence and discrimination.
"There are two separate issues here," Gilmore told Windy City Times. "One is the information provided by a police department to media and the second is the media's investigation and how they develop standards on correctly identifying people."
According to Gilmore, the appalling consequences of these mistakes are far reaching. They transcend the damage wrought to the memory of the victim and the love accorded to her by those family and friends who chose to embrace her identity.
Transgender women of color are being systematically wiped out as a result of the rejection and dehumanization they face at all levels of society, married to what Black Lives Matter strategic partner and GetEQUAL Central Regional Coordinator Elle Hearns termed "respectability politics."
"It has a huge impact on our ability to track and get a clear picture of what's happening," Gilmore said. "Particularly when we are talking about a homicide. The victim-and most important witness-can't provide us with information, so we have to rely on the accounts that someone else provides, whether it is media or law enforcement. This isn't just about counting numbers. This is about preventing this kind of violence by changing the conditions in which it happens. We have to determine whether there were hate- or bias-motivated elements or if it was a case of domestic or intimate partner violence. We can't do prevention if we don't know the reality of the situations that are occurring."
Dr. Paul Schewe, the director of the University of Illinois (UIC) Interdisciplinary Center for Research on Violence, agreed. As a researcher he has worked with the Center on Halsted (COH), the Chicago Commission on Human Relations (CCHR) and the Cook County State's Attorney's office.
"It is entirely important that we have accurate numbers," he told Windy City Times. "Now that all sorts of research is trying to be more gender sensitive, it's a real struggle."
Windy City Times examined the issue from the standpoint of law enforcement and the advocacy groups who track and monitor media response in an attempt to determine a cause and possible solutions to misgendering and revictimization.
Crime scene 101
Brian Dorow has held the position of associate dean of criminal justice, homeland security and counter terrorism at Waukesha County Technical College in Wisconsin for 11 years. Prior to that, he spent a decade as a city of Waukesha police supervisor.
"When it comes to a homicide, the general rule of thumb is that you have 48 hours to do what you can to solve it," he explained. "Or your leads dry up and your witnesses may become uncooperative. There is high pressure in the first two days. For investigators, every crime scene has a story to tell. You have to start looking at the physical evidence there, what is not there and if there are witnesses. When you approach a body, you're going to make an initial observation-what is that person wearing or not wearing?
"Is there an obvious sign of trauma, a bullet wound, a stab wound? Where is the body? You have to document all this information. You look for identification-a driver's license or an identification card-or you look for identifiers. Does this person have tattoos? Is the person missing a finger? However, sometimes you don't have that information available. At that point, you have a specialist come and take fingerprints and hopefully the victim has a record of some kind where you can make an identification."
Bill Schade is one such specialist. He has been a forensics practitioner for 40 years. Schade told Windy City Times that fingerprints are the most common starting point for a search using biometrics-one not based on a name or demographic data.
"In the 1970s and '80s, computers didn't have the power to search everything," he said. "We had to narrow the search down as much as we could and so we used sex, race or sometimes year-of-birth as a filter so that we weren't looking for a needle in the biggest haystack. Race was always something that could be subjective. How was it designated in the database? When you didn't know that, there was a chance that you would miss it in the search. As the technology has progressed, we have eliminated artificial filters because they can cause problems. The systems are so powerful now that we can do searches against the entire database and let the biometrics filter out the results rather than by a subjective decision from the person who created the record. Having said that, if we're searching an individual's prints we are doing a broad-based search against those databases and the results that come back are going to be whatever was put on file. So if the record is in the name of 'John Smith' and the sex and race is 'male and white', that will be what we report back to an investigator as a lead."
According to Schewe, the Chicago Police Department (CPD) is cooperating with advocacy groups to change its record-keeping practices in regards to an individual's gender identity. His own work as a researcher determined a number of factors that must be considered. "In asking someone to describe their gender identity, we came up with as many as 20 different check boxes for people," Schewe noted. "When police are filling out their forms, they don't have very good categories for indicating a person's gender identity. There are some people in the trans community who say 'no, I'm not transgender male or female. I'm male. I'm female. That's always been my identity'."
"Quite honestly in the forensics field, everybody's a number," Schade said. "I have been asked for years 'what is the real name?' because the record comes back with an alias. But we categorize a person by a number that's assigned. You can have many names, but you can only have one biometric ID number."
For investigators, even the increased ability to engage in biometrics such as facial or iris recognition and hand geometry does not change the demographic information contained within the system such as the name and gender behind an individual's social security number or state identification.
"If we're not checking a fingerprint or a facial image to confirm identity, we're creating records in error," Schade said. "That's why law enforcement has always used biometric data as a foundation. We run the biometric and we will come back with maybe a driver's license photo and then you go to that record to see what information is on file. If Caitlyn Jenner hasn't changed her driver's license and she is the victim of a crime in California and we run her prints, who would it come back to? It has nothing to do with the forensic identification. It points to the correct record but it all depends on the information that's on file."
With a majority of transgender individuals living far below the poverty line, unable to get or maintain a job due to ongoing discrimination, the cost for them to change that information is well beyond their reach.
In Cook County, the filing fee alone for a name change is $337. The additional requirement that a name change must be published before a final judgement is provided can-in the case of the Chicago Daily Law Bulletinadd $150 to the bill.
Cook County offers a fee-waiver program, but navigating through a bureaucratic maze that involves multiple floors of the Daley Center in order to obtain the required forms without the help of an attorney is a daunting prospect.
Despite the efforts of advocacy groups such as the Transformative Justice Law Project of Illinois, which offers free, regular name-change mobilizations to assist individuals with the filing of forms, there are many transgender individuals whose gender markers and birth names remain unchanged in the system.
Even if an autopsy at a medical examiner's office notes the presence of synthetic hormones in a body, such information is not always immediately available.
"There certainly can be a delay in those reports," Dorow said. "It depends on what you are looking for and what is needed."
Yet the question remains as to why police departments are so quick to release a victim's incorrect gender identity as information to the media-"feeding the beast" as one police source who preferred not to be named termed it.
Blige had begun hormone replacement therapy before she was murdered. Had investigators from the Aurora PD waited for reports from the medical examiner before releasing information to WGN, the fact that she was transitioning could have been taken into account despite the information contained in her public records.
"It's usually case-by-case," Dorow said. "You've come across a body. You know the clock is ticking. There is pressure. When homicides hit the news, that's the front page and gets a lot of attention in communities that have a small number of homicides each year. But there's no protocol that says you have to release information at a certain time. It's based on the situation, the needs of the investigation and whether or not the investigators are looking for the general public to come forward. There could be not enough awareness in this area. It requires further training now and in the future."
Windy City Times asked the Aurora Police Department about their policy in releasing information to the media. Director of Public Information for the City of Aurora Dan Ferrelli released the following statement:
"While every homicide investigation presents unique challenges based on facts and evidence and are investigated as those elements dictate, one consistent rule is that the Aurora Police Department will only release the name and other identifying information on a homicide victim after the family of the victim is notified. The identification is generally based on documents such as ID cards and drivers licenses, visual observations made by personnel, medical records, statements made by family and friends, and other factors. When a homicide occurs, our number one focus is finding the person or people responsible for taking a human life, no matter what the gender of the victim may be, and holding the offender responsible. If during the course of the investigation, we discover that there are signs that lead to a hate crime or other extenuating circumstance, those factors are taken into consideration and aggressively addressed."
Ferrelli went on to note the Blige investigation as "a very good example of the challenges we face in these types of cases. From the time we began investigating this murder it was evident that the victim had the physical characteristics of a male, he was dressed as a male, his identification listed him as male, all of the interviews we conducted (including family members) referred to Ms. Blige in masculine terms ('him, he, etc.')."
In May 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice Community Relations Service (DOJCRS) began to offer transgender law enforcement training in partnership and collaboration with a number of police departments across the country and advocacy organizations such as the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce.
Grande H. Lum is the director of the DOJCRS. "Since we launched over a year ago, for example in the Chicago area, our regional office has held trainings in North, Central and Southern Illinois for over 1,000 law enforcement officers," he told Windy City Times. "The identification of gender is fundamental. When you provide training to law enforcement officers, especially ones who are going to an academy, that's where it can make a significant difference in understanding that the [gender] preference of an individual is critical. I don't think we want situations where a transgender victim is being misgendered and it's picked up by the media. I don't think that helps anyone."
The curriculum for basic recruit training at the Chicago Police Department comprises 1,000 hours (over twice the Illinois state mandate) and between 400 and 480 hours for the Cook County Sheriff's Department and other statewide academies. It is governed by the Illinois Law Enforcement Training & Standards Board. They have yet to include the DOJCRS's or any transgender sensitivity training.
Calls to the board were not returned.
"There certainly are some police departments who are reluctant or resistant to bringing in this training," Lum acknowledged. "Our services are strictly voluntary. We can do this work because the jurisdiction was opened up by the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009. At the same time, there have been a lot of requests and we've heard very positive things from communities. They can see the benefit and the value of their officers going through [the program]. Law enforcement organizations that are effective are ones that understand their communities better."
"In the [Wisconsin] academy you get diversity and sensitivity training built into the curriculum," Dorow said. "I'm involved in the training of in excess of 10,000 police officers on an annual basis. The law enforcement profession is always evolving. At the end of the day, it comes down to training. Especially with a homicide, it's so crucial to know all of the facts. Proper identification is only going to help your investigation and the successful prosecution of a suspect."
Ferrelli said that the Aurora PD would "consider training offered by the Department of Justice in order to bring a sense of justice to all crime victims."
Along with the training already offered by the DOJCRS, Lum announced that the department will release a roll call video to coincide with this year's Transgender Day of Remembrance.
It has been created with the participation of transgender individuals and experienced police officers. "The video will have different scenarios where there's an interaction between a law enforcement officer and an individual who is transgender," Lum said. "We use a situation where there's been a traffic stop and one where a police officer comes to an apartment. It pro- vides some best practices and you can also see [what happens] when it doesn't go well. I think it's going to make a difference because the audience is going to be law enforcement officers."
The media
However, the video's audience will not be the general public who receive their transgender sensitivity training from the media outlets which report a crime against a transgender individual.
"The press is looking for information, they follow the police scanner and they want it as quickly as possible," Schade said. "Usually [the media] accuse us of withholding it. The last thing we want to do is release bad information."
"In Keyshia's case, The Beacon News could have taken a very different route," Gilmore said, "by not using her former name or a headline referring to her as male. But they took the route of gendering her as a man even though they were getting information from very close to her that she had started transitioning."
The media does have help.
Among the many resources that they have made freely available to the press, the nationwide advocacy group GLAAD has an extensive transgender Media Reference Guide as well as a Doubly Victimized repor-a step-by-step guide with examples of what and what not to do in everything from pronoun usage to the appropriate use of names when reporting but not exploiting the transgender status of an individual who has been the victim of a crime.
The National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association has a similar report for media to use, and at their conference in San Francisco Sept. 3-5, several panels addressed the misgendering of transgender subjects, both alive and dead.
Dani Heffernan is the senior strategist for transgender media at GLAAD. "I think journalists who are covering these stories need to understand why victims who are transgender are misgendered," Heffernan said. "When they are receiving these reports from police, if they think that the victim might be transgender, they should be reaching out to family members, to local trans or LGBT organizations in the area to find out more. Journalists should be open to making changes to their stories when people in those communities contact them and say 1 know how a person identified'. They should be receptive to that."
Despite the resources available, looking back over the 19 known women murdered in 2015 shows that many of the media outlets are not open to correcting an initial misgendering.
The nonprofit monitoring organization Media Matters for America has called to account a number of press outlets for misgendering and misidentifying transgender victims. LGBT Program Director Carlos Maza believes there is no excuse.
"The media's insistence on blaming police reports or deferring responsibility to police departments isn't a widely accepted reflection of journalistic practices," he told Windy City Times. "This idea that a news outlet's only job is to repeat press releases without questioning their validity or doing their own investigative research contradicts the public's general understanding of what the role of the media is. The excuse that media outlets are exempt from responsibility is curious because, in any other area of reporting, if there is no fact checking or followup we understand that to be bad journalism."
GLAAD has often stepped in with a number of strategies designed to positively intervene and assist media outlets who misgender or misidentify a trans individual. The results are mixed.
"We've had situations come up with small and national papers when they become aware of the guidelines or the story that they wrote is inaccurate, that they are open and genuinely concerned about making those changes," Heffernan said. "There are also times when that doesn't happen and when one conversation with a journalist is not enough to have changes made to the story. Then we are talking to local organizations on the ground about next steps."
"Unfortunately, in some cases we're still dealing with transphobia," Maza said. "There are still journalists out there who don't take trans people, their stories or their identities seriously and it's going to be very hard-even with pressure-to encourage them to stop misgendering trans victims of violence. For a bigger subset of the journalistic population, the issue is fear and anxiety about being ahead of the herd or at the cutting edge of what really is a revolution within the industry and social acceptance of the LGBT community at large.
"The movement from treating trans people as jokes and punchlines to taking them seriously has occurred relatively rapidly in terms of the media landscape. Especially for smalltown reporters, the fear is 1 don't want to call someone trans when they're not. I don't want to be the one who's over-zealous.' There is a reluctance to chance old habits. The failure to correctly identify trans victims properly is in conflict with basic and widely accepted journalistic guidelines. It has gone beyond laziness. It has gone beyond ignorance. It is now an active form of bad journalism and the work that activists and advocates have to do is to remind journalists that this is not an acceptable practice and there is no credible defense."
When a media outlet is resistant to change, GLAAD's next steps are designed to bring attention to the problem and to apply public pressure.
"There was a national outlet that had misgendered a transgender woman of color who was brutally murdered and they were not initially open to making changes to the story," Heffernan recalled. "GLAAD worked with local advocates. There was a petition asking for the paper to make changes to the story. That led to an editorial board meeting where we talked to the outlet about their style guide. Eventually they did ensure that their coverage of transgender people will be respectful going forward."
Despite these successes, Heffernan acknowledged that there is still a great deal of work to do: "This year especially, I hope that most journalists are aware of the enormous levels of violence facing transgender people and transgender women of color in particular."
"The solution is really as simple as looking at context and clues, being patient and cautious," Maza said. "In a lot of cases where a news outlet misreports the gender of a victim of violence, there is at least enough evidence to raise concerns about whether the gender identification given by the police department should be taken at face value. We've seen that a lot this year, where news outlets noted in police reports that the victim was dressed in a way that was atypical for their gender or went by a name that wasn't their birth name, or was referred to by friends and loved ones and by themselves on social media using gender markers or names that weren't in alignment with police reports. Those kinds of clues should tip off even amateur journalists that maybe using the gender identification given by the police department isn't the safest bet and maybe there's more to the story. There really isn't a credible defense of doing bad reporting."
Windy City Times reached out to the Aurora Beacon News for comment on its March 24 article.
Editor Anne Halston replied with a statement.
"As you know, our story talked about Bryce Stiff's stage persona of Keyshia Blige," it read. "But we did not know that was an identity or name used off the stage. We relied on information presented to us at the time through public documents and interviews. The police identified the shooting victim as Bryce Stiff, a man. The victim's mother, other family members and friends all referred to the victim as Bryce and used male pronouns. At the funeral, some friends even wore commemorative T-shirts that referred to the victim as 'Bryce'."
Halston went on to state that the Beacon News does utilize available resources when writing about transgender individuals. "As a newspaper, we follow the AP [Associated Press] guidelines on gender-identity issues. I am familiar with the GLAAD guidelines and have consulted those as well."
The AP's most recent guidelines state, "Transgender: Use the pronoun preferred by the individuals who have acquired the physical characteristics of the opposite sex or present themselves in a way that does not correspond with their sex at birth. If that preference is not expressed, use the pronoun consistent with the way the individuals live publicly."
"The gold standard for journalists at large should be GLAAD's guidelines," Maza said. "The AP doesn't give guidance about general practices that journalists should be adopting when researching and writing these kinds of pieces. When news outlets are dealing with quickly evolving media landscapes, if there is a concern or a question about the victim's gender marker, the impulse should be cautious and neutral in reporting or be very certain about the way that they're identifying. It is easy to use gender neutral markers, to not use gender pronouns, to not include the word 'man' in a headline. Those things are very rarely necessary for an initial news report about a crime."
"As we're talking to a paper, we really press the importance of accurately identifying transgender people in their stories," Heffernan said. "Our report that specifically talks about those people who are victims of crime is called Doubly Victimized because these-usually transgender women of color-who are killed or murdered are revictimized by the media coverage that misgenders them. It is disturbing to see the lack of attention being brought to these murders on a national level. If the media is not covering them or not doing it correctly then we just don't know the numbers of transgender women who are being murdered."
"When a news outlet misgenders a victim it is straight-up, dangerous misinformation for the general public which is trying to understand what occurred in these incidents," Maza said. "It robs audiences of the ability to see the landscape under which these particular events are occurring. All the public hears about trans people are these high-profile celebrities or the sensationalistic trans stories that we typically see. They don't see the real acts of violence that have almost become unremarkable at this point. There's no context for a reader or television viewer to understand where this violence comes from and what potential solutions might be. When a media outlet parrots a police department report, it serves to undermine the success of the investigations being done about these incidents."
"It is important that we understand the level of violence and discrimination facing transgender people," Heffernan noted. "The consequence of not covering it is that people don't have a clear picture of what life is like for so many transgender people in this country."

Abstract: After the archiving event I was just in awe of the community stepping up and sharing what Amigas Latinas has meant to them," said [Alma Izquierdo]. "To hear an individual who was at a very challenging and difficult point in their life tell their story and just knowing that Amigas Latinas was there to help them that to me is the epitome of what Amigas Latinas has meant to the community. It's really had an impact on the LGBTQ community here in Chicago and across the United States.

Full text:   This month, Amigas Latinas will be folding after 20 years of support, advocacy and education for Chicago-area LGBTQ Latinas.
Co-founded in 1995 by Evette Cardona, Mona Noriega, Alicia Amador, Aurora Pineda, Karen Rothstein-Pineda, Norma Seledon, Mary Torres and Lydia Vega, Amigas Latinas grew from a monthly discussion group (platicas) to a non-profit organization providing services and events for LGBTQ Latinas and their allies.
On the eve of Amigas Latinas' final event, a number of leaders from over the years reflected on their time with the organization and how they feel about the organization ending. Although Amigas Latinas is folding, the organization's materials will be housed at the Gerber/Hart Library and Archives, and be made available to anyone seeking information about the organization. The library continues to accept materials from the organization to add to the archives.
Cardona-vice-president of programs for the Polk Bros. Foundation and Amigas Latinas' first board president-said that establishing the Aixa Diaz Latina Youth Scholarship Fund after Diaz, one of Amigas Latinas' other co-founders who died in 1999, was really important because it gave the organization an opportunity to support young Latina queer activists who were actively fighting homophobia in their schools and/or communities.
"With the recent Pride Parade I've been remembering when Amigas had their own float and the crowd would go wild when they saw us because I'd like to think that they weren't expecting a Latina queer float to come by with 50 women just wallowing in our lesbianism," said Cardona."I've had fun marching in the parade over the years but the best times were when Amigas had a float and I was marching with them."
Cardona noted that starting the Amiguitas Youth Group and doing service provider training for larger Latin@ organizations on how to better serve Latin@ queers as well as helping mainstream LGBTQ organizations figure out how to deal with Latin@ LGBTQ people were also important work that Amigas Latinas did. She also explained that the family work that they did, including picnics and discussion groups with children of queer Latinas, was also very exciting.
"I want people to know that so many things were different 20 years ago," said Cardona. "When we first started Amigas we could've never envisioned marriage or two women choosing to have children together and being out as a family. We couldn't have envisioned all the Latina queer women who are in positions of power and influence as they are now, whether it's Mona working for the City of Chicago [as the chair and commissioner of the Commission on Human Relations], me in my job or Alicia [Vega] being the vice-president of youth development at the Boys and Girls Club of Chicago, because you don't get more American than the Boys and Girls Club."
"In terms of Amigas folding, it was time," said Cardona. "That single need for one space where all Latina lesbians could gather isn't true anymore because we are everywhere. I always say that 20 years of organizing in the LGBTQ community is measured in dog years, not people years."
Noriega, Cardona's wife and founding board member of Amigas Latinas, said she really enjoyed all the family events as well as addressing intersectionality within the organization because part of what made Amigas Latinas important to her was sharing and exploring multiple identities.
As for what the organization has meant to her, Noriega said, "I'm happy for all the years that it existed, all the women I met and all the relationships that I formed. I feel like it was a consistent nurturing force in my life. I was able to learn and make contributions as we created a community. I will always appreciate that development opportunity and remember Amigas as a safe, warm and loving place where we both loved and challenged each other."
Vega, current archive coordinator and former board member of Amigas Latinas, noted that she was the first person to respond to Cardona's ad looking for Latina lesbians to become members of Amigas Latina.
"As I was coming out and embracing my identity, Amigas Latinas was the only place where I could bring all of myself-Latina and lesbian- to the table," said Vega. "After years of receiving support, I joined the board and found my place to give back to the community. I also learned fundraising, event planning and grant writing while on the board. So even though I gave of my time, I still gained so much more."
Vega explained that during her time on the board she spearheaded the first-of-its-kind comprehensive study of LGBTQ Latina women in Chicago called Proyecto Latina, which documented domestic-violence incidents, how and when people come out, discrimination and other aspects in the life-cycle of LGBTQ Latina women.
"As for Amigas folding, 20 years is a significantly long history, especially for a grassroots organization," said Vega. "Amigas Latinas has made an impact on so many lives and its impact will live on in the lives of those it touched. The official closing of the organization is administrative; the legacy of Amigas Latins lives on. The timing and way in which Amigas Latinas is folding are graceful and respectful. You rarely see this happen in this way."
Lourdes Torres-professor of Latin American and Latino studies at DePaul University and former board member and president of Amigas Latinas-recalled that when she moved to Chicago in 2000, one of the first things she did was look for queer Latina spaces. When she found Amigas Latinas, she immediately got involved. She noted that her first meeting was a focus group to figure out Amigas Latinas' next steps so she ended up learning a lot about the group from that meeting. Torres said she started going to events after that meeting but didn't participate on the board until 2006.
Torres said that she signed on to help Vega with her Proyecto Latina survey and she, along with Nicole Perez-a grad student who later became an Amigas Latinas board membersurveyed 305 queer Latina women in Chicago. They wrote up the findings of the survey which was published in 2008 by the non-profit group Mujeres Latinas En Acción. The report is currently housed on its website.
"It was important for me to be able to contribute to Amigas Latinas in that way," said Torres. "After the study was done we started responding to the issues including the high incidents of domestic violence within the Latina queer community. We held a series of successful platicas to train women on ways to deal with these issues in a productive way within their own community. That was cool because it involved Latinas who were members of the organization as well as queer friendly women who worked on issues surrounding domestic violence. One of the things I loved about Amigas Latinas was that it wasn't just about providing entertainment and social opportunities it was also about responding to significant issues within our own community."
Torres explained that she wanted to use her academic skills to document the history of the organization because what they were doing was unique and her concern was it wasn't being documented.
"If you look at studies of queer organizations, usually they only focus on the East and West coast and leave out the Midwest, like nothing is happening here, and that's especially true when you think about people of color organizing, because very little ofthat history is being documented," said Torres.
Torres has written two articles about this. One is in the Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies and the other one was included in the companion book that came out when the Chicago History Museum had its "Out in Chicago" exhibit.
"What was great about Amigas Latinas was it wasn't just one big group," said Torres. "There were subgroups, including Madurando Elegante for older women; the youth group Amiguitas; and Entre Familia for families that were created to meet the needs of the different demographics within Amigas Latinas. When they got together, intergenerational connections occurred."
"I'm sad that it's ending but I'm grateful for the experience I got when I was a member of the leadership of the organization because it introduced me to Chicago politics in a new way, helped me develop new skills in terms of organizing and speaking to the media as well as running meetings and doing all kinds of things that I hadn't done politically," said Torres. "It was a great space for creating leaders and I'm grateful for that in my life and also for the other women of Amigas who've become leaders in their fields."
Alma Izquierdo-head of the makeup department on NBC's Chicago PD and Amigas Latinas' final board president-first got involved with Amigas Latinas by attending and promoting its events in the late 1990s. In 2010, she became a board member when the late Christina Santiago and Rosa Yadira Ortiz, who was then the board president, asked her to be on the board. Two years later, she became the board president.
"I will always remember the Siempre Latina galas that I helped organize," said Izquierdo. "It was a beautiful thing to see everyone there supporting Amigas Latinas. Also, the last event that I put together [was] at the Center on Halsted, with the comedian Sandra Vails and C.C. Carter as the emcee. It was a packed house and everyone had a great time."
As for the decision to dissolve the organization, Izquierdo said that, organically, it wasn't moving in the same direction as the Latina LGBTQ community as a whole was. Over time, she added, it was difficult to find people who were able to put in the time, effort and energy that it takes to run an organization like Amigas Latinas. Izquierdo noted that it took her about a year and a half to come to this decision. She added that she also met with a number of other leaders in the community for guidance as well as with Cardona, Noriega and a few of the other founders prior to making this decision.
"Since this announcement I've had people approach me and tell me that they want to start something new and I think that's wonderful," said Izquierdo. "I'm hoping that this situation will cause people to step up and either create something new or mentor and support the younger generation to help them become leaders. If that happens it will be the silver lining to Amigas folding."
"After the archiving event I was just in awe of the community stepping up and sharing what Amigas Latinas has meant to them," said Izquierdo. "To hear an individual who was at a very challenging and difficult point in their life tell their story and just knowing that Amigas Latinas was there to help them that to me is the epitome of what Amigas Latinas has meant to the community. It's really had an impact on the LGBTQ community here in Chicago and across the United States. To this day I'm still getting emails from people that have and are still using the survey that we did on domestic violence in the queer Latina community to this day."
Pineda-a bilingual (Spanish) benefits/ medical case manager at The Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center and founding board member of Amigas Latinas-has had a journey with the organization that's included meeting and marrying her wife. They later became parents but also participated in the creation of the organization's mission/vision statement and by-laws when Amigas Latinas obtained its non-profit status.
"During the October 2002 LLEGO International Conference in Miami, where we represented Amigas Latinas, my wife [Karen RothsteinPineda] and I decided to be a part of Catholic commitment ceremony which several other couples participated," said Pineda. "Evette and Mona were our commitment/wedding madrinas. Lydia Vega was my best women and Norma Seledon was Karen's maid of honor."
Pineda explained that, for her, Amigas Latinas was the place where she transformed from a shy and quiet person to an advocate for the LGBTQ community as well as the underserved youth, young adults and undocumented individuals that she sees at work.
"It was hard for me to hear that Amigas might need to fold but I did have the privilege, along with other members of Amigas, of making this hard decision," said Pineda, "I thank Alma for all her hard work and taking on this final task as president. I think it's time for others to come up with something new. Amigas Latinas did a lot but there are many lessons that can be learned. I support the fact that Amigas Latinas' history will be archived for others to see, examine and learn from."
"It's with a very heavy heart that I/we say 'adiós' to one the most honored and respected organizations of our Latina/o and LGBTQ family and community," said Julio Rodriguez, president of the board of directors of the Association for Latinos/as Motivating Action. "As leaders of a critical organization, the women of Amigas Latinas were sisters and mentors and they gave a voice and spirit to the Latina movement in Chicago.
"Unfortunately, the departure of Amigas Latinas from the Latino and LGBTQ movement is another example of the lack of resources and supports for grassroots advocacy and organizing by both the public and private sectors. Finally, we can never forget the amazing contributions and accomplishments that Amigas Latinas gave to our movement and our collective families. It is now up to the rest of us to carry on the legacy. Adiós, mis amigas!"
"The loss of Amigas Latinas leaves a big hole in the LGBTQ social justice movement, especially in this moment where organizations that primarily serve queer and trans people of color are closing across the country," said Kim Hunt, executive director of Affinity Community Services. "Affinity honors the work and the history of Amigas Latinas and will always consider its leaders and constituents to be sisters in the struggle."
Amigas Latinas' last event, "Siempre Latina Celebrando 20 Años," will take place Friday, July 10, 8 p.m.-l a.m. at Michelle's Ballroom, 2800 W. Belmont Ave.

Full text:   Following the Feb. 10 murder of transgender woman Penny Proud in New Orleans, the community nationwide was stunned as two more trans and gender-exploring individuals were slain in the United States within the span of five days.
On Feb. 13 in Akron, Ohio, 22-year-old Brian Golee was stabbed to death by Golec's father who is now in police custody under a charge of murder.
On Feb. 15, the body of 46-year-old Kristina Gomez-Reinwald, known as Kristina Grant Infiniti, was discovered in her home.
In the Golee case, both national and international media Leaped on the story but with no accord as to Golec's own preference, they scrambled for a label regardless of assertions and desperate pleas to stop made by Golec's own family, fiancée and friends. The United Kingdom publication The Daily Mail referred to Golee as a "transgender daughter." The New York Daily News headline read "transgender son." People magazine followed suit but did acknowledge friends who said that Golec's "gender identity was fluid." CNN via its HLN website referred to Golee as a "transgender person."
A Feb. 18 statement from the National Coalition of Anti Violence Programs (NCAVP) said that "Golee hated labels."
Golec's obituary posted on the Newcomer Funeral Home & Cremation Services website described the Ohio Virtual Academy graduate and musician as "a deeply spiritual and artistic person" with interests that included "painting, jewelry making, meditation, martial arts, video games, and anime."
In his farewell, Golec's friend David Timko said "You are a beautiful soul and will be missed on this earth more than you ever realized. Thank you for inspiring me and for putting so much Love out into the world with what Little time you were given. The world needs more people who think Like you, not Less."
On the blog Riot in the Rain, Australian game developer Riot Jayne cut through the frenzied dust brought on by the sudden onslaught of media interest. According to Jayne, the confusion began with a post on Facebook by a member of an Akron trans support group "who, upon hearing of Brian's death, and remembering them as Bri, took to Facebook to discuss their grief over yet another trans woman passing."
"Unfortunately we cannot Learn what Brian would have preferred in terms of pronouns, but we can trust the many many friends and family who have come out to say that although they are very open and accepting of trans people, Brian was not identifying as a trans woman, despite the gender exploration in Brian's Life," Jayne wrote. "We-of all people-should do our part in making sure that Brian be remembered as they would have preferred."
On a community Facebook page set up to remember Golee one friend wrote "I've thought about all the controversy around Brian's gender; how angry and wrathful some people are about it, I've thought about my own anger at his father and my desire for vengeance, I've been so mad that I was shaking. I've been so overcome with grief that I couldn't even cry. Then, unbidden, come thoughts of peace."
In the Gomez-Reinwald murder, the NCAVP stated Feb. 19 that "Local advocacy organizations and community members believe this was an intimate partner violence homicide."
By now, vigils for slain transgender individuals had become a weekly occurrence. GomezReinwald's was held on Feb. 19, while Local television news affiliates kept their own precedent by ignoring GLAAD's media guidelines on reporting about the transgender community.
NBC 6 South Florida's video report referred to her as a "transgender man" while CBS Miami noted that the vigil was held "to raise awareness about crimes against transgendered people."
In a far more respectful piece headlined "6 Transgender Women Have Been Murdered in 2015 and No One is Talking About It," MTV Journalist Katie Speller wrote that GomezReinwald "was an accomplished performer in the Miami House Scene's balls-pageant competitions that involve skills in dance, drag and performance. She was known for her Love of old-school drama, her passion for flamenco music and her Love of memorable feather-filled performances. She had a brother she adored, a mother who stood by her, and a family of both transgender and drag sisters she mentored and Looked out for."
According to WSVN 7 News, her friends described her as a "beautiful person" who shared whatever she had when somebody needed it.
One post on her Facebook vigil page read "She has achieved success who has Lived well, laughed often, and Loved much; Who has enjoyed the trust of women, the respect of men and the Love of Little children; Who has filled her niche and accomplished her task; Who has never lacked appreciation of Earth's beauty or failed to express it; Who has Left the world better than she found it, Whether an improved poppy, a perfect poem, or a rescued soul; Who has always Looked for the best in others and given them the best she had; Whose Life was an inspiration; Whose memory a benediction."
As of Feb. 21, the tally of transgender and gender non-conforming individuals murdered in the U.S. depends upon the media source. One thing everyone appears to agrees upon: Whether the figure is six or eight, it's too many.
Including pictures of each of the transgender women or gender non-conforming individuals of color murdered so far in 2015-Lamar Edwards (20), Lamia Beard (30), Ty Nunee Underwood (24), Yazmin Vash Payne (33) Taja Gabrielle De Jesus (36), Penny Proud (21) and Grant Infiniti-the sign for the Torch of Friendship vigil held in downtown Miami on Feb. 19 read "2015 just started. Please stop killing us."
On the pop culture website The Mary Sue, writer Marcy Cook wondered "Is the media up in arms about this insanely high murder rate? Two people caught Ebola in the U.S. and the media went into a frenzy that Lasted weeks. After six murders of TWoC the media has barely reacted."
"We need more public awareness and respect campaigns, more people speaking out against this violence, and more protections, particuLarLy for transgender people, from harassment and discrimination," stated the NCAVP. "This is an outrage, and we all have to commit as a nation to ending this violence."
Domestic violence also an epidemic
The Grant Infinity murder is also part of another disturbing trend in the LGBT community, intimate partner violence. Mirroring the general society, the LGBT community certainly has its share of such murders.
The NCAVP reported on the intimate partner violence homicide of Oscar Mendez in Lawrence, Massachusetts. According to Local media, Miguel Rivera, 50, is accused of fatally stabbing his boyfriend, Oscar Mendez, 39, at their apartment.
This is the seventh intimate partner, family or stalking related homicide of an LGBTQ person that NCAVP has responded to in 2015. NCAVP has responded to 13 LGBTQ homicides in 2015. "To the best of our knowledge, seven of the incidents have been intimate partner, family or stalking violence-related and six have been hate violence-related. However, as with all incidents, as we get more information we may find that the homicides has different motivations than originally reported," the group stated.
"In 2015 we are seeing an alarming number of intimate partner violence related homicides of LGBTQ people," said Chai Jindasurat, co-director of community organizing and public advocacy at the New York City Anti Violence Project. "We need more education, services, and prevention programs that seek to end intimate partner violence in LGBTQ and HIV-affected communities."
In NCAVP's report Intimate Partner Violence in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and HIV Affected Communities in 2013, released on Oct. 15, 2014, there were 21 IPV homicides in 2012 and2013. In 2013, 76 percent of victims were gay men. Both years represent the highest number of homicides ever recorded to NCAVP. This is up from 19 IPV homicides in 2011 and more than three times the 6 documented homicides in 2010. Additionally, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Lesbians, gay men and bisexual people experience intimate partner violence at the same or higher rates as non-LGB people.

Abstract: With domestic violence, I'm very well-connected with Clara's House, the oldest domestic violence shelter in Englewood. This year, Mrs. Kirk, their founder, derided to team up with members of the PRCC [Puerto Rican Cultural Center]-Project VIDA. I met with a number of their people, they were here in the ward, and they were mentioning about transgender domestic violence, those issues.

Full text:   Raymond Lopez is one of several candidates eying the 15th Ward aldermanic seat. A 2012 redistricting resulted in a massive shift in the ward's demographics-its residents were predominantly African American but Latino residents are now the main constituency.
The current alderman, Toni Foulkes, is currently campaigning for a post representing the 16th Ward, Leaving the field open for Lopez, who's been the Democratic committeeman since 2012, as well as five other candidates, including Adolfo Mondragon, Rafael Yanez, Eddie Daniels, Otis Davis Jr. and Raul 0. Reyes.
Lopez-who is openly gay and grew up in the Sleepy Hollow neighborhood that is close to Midway Airport-has been maintaining two offices as committeeman, and says that he has been helping keep ward services running since the redistricting. His partner, Hugo Orejel, is his political director; Orejel's mother works in the offices as well.
In January, Lopez received the endorsement of the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund, along with incumbent Aids. Deb Mell, Tom Tunney and James Cappleman. Windy City Times spoke with him about his work and aspirations for the ward.
Windy City Times: Why did you deride to run?
Raymond Lopez: I derided to run because our ward needs Leadership. I ran in 2011. It went into a runoff, but in a differently drawn ward. Even then, it was obvious that we needed someone with a vision. Following that, I was elected committeeman in 2012 and this campaign, in 2015, is just a natural progression for everything we've done up until this point. I basically have been the only elected official servicing this ward, and that's going to help me take it up to the next Level.
WCT: Are you working in a day job in addition to your function as a committeeman?
RL: I worked for Southwest Airlines for 12 years. I've Left Southwest because I'm that confident about taking this to the finish Line.
WCT: What was some of your political experience prior to becoming committeman?
RL: I started in politics when I was 18 years old. I started on the Southwest Side as a precinct captain, in a different ward, but I Learned a Lot about what made politics good in a community. That interaction with people in the community on a daily basis, helping them get connected with what they needed-we're talking in the age of pre-311; that's how far back we're going-there was a value to that. Being able to now, as "the man in charge of the ward," being able to reinstitute that while simultaneously adding new things Like Facebook and Twitter to what we do, has been very inspiring and fulfilling.
WCT: What are the most pertinent issues in the ward right now?
RL: Without question, [it's] restoring a sense of safety and security in the community. Every day you Look in the newspaper: "Man shot in Englewood." Gang issues, drug issues ... every day there's a constant reminder that things are getting out of control. Restoring order is priority number one. After that everything else will fall into place, because then you can start recruiting for jobs, bringing businesses into the community, fostering safer environments for education in zones around schools. In three of our schools, we've had shootings within a block of them in the past three months alone. You cannot expect kids to Learn in that kind of environment.
WCT: What are the predominant education issues in the ward?
RL: In the 15th Ward, we have two different dynamics when it comes to education. In the predominantly Latino areas, we are seeing nearingor already-overcrowding in our schools. ... Overcrowding and bullying are the major issues in the Latino areas. There are schools where I get phone calls-Gonzales in Brighton Park, I've been to that school five times because of bullying-and some of it LGBT-related, some of it not. They've had attempted suicide by children there. Their parents are pulling them out and sending them to charter schools because they're getting no answers.
Gage Park and West Englewood, exact opposite scenario: ALL the schools in those areas were slated for closure under the consolidation introduced by Mayor Emanuel. In West Englewood, we were able to fight to keep Henderson School open, but we weren't able to keep Earl open. It ended up being consolidated, forcing our residents to cross Damen Avenue, gang Lines. Everything we don't Like talking about, we've forced our kids to do it, as well as forcing Henderson to serve 4,000 families ... Going back to the safety issues for our schools, there over 350 abandoned buildings surrounding the schools, vacant and unsecured.... In 2013, we had a young man who was pulled into one on his way to school, and beaten for two days in one of these buildings.
WCT: What are your thoughts on neighborhood services?
RL: I'm the only candidate who has said that I would maintain two offices. I have this office in Brighton Park and another one in West Englewood, and I intend to keep them both, because with our map, there's no way that I can get a Little old lady from 67th and Marshfield down here on CTA. Even though it might be an expense, it will be better for producing services, as well as hiring staff that is customer-oriented. Obviously, I'm a product of Southwest Airlines-12 years there, so I'm all about customer service.... We can do fun apps and plow trackers and what not, but most of my residents who call me don't have a smart phone. They're Looking for their alderman to tell them everything is working the right way. As committeeman, all my residents have my cell phone number and I'm not changing my number when I become alderman.
WCT: What do you want to do to stimulate economic development and job creation in the ward?
RL: As of right now, there are about 206 business Leaders in the ward. When I became committeeman, there were 260. In two years time, one-fifth of our businesses have disappeared. One of the main issues facing our businesses is their taxes. They are overtaxed because they have multiple layers added on to their taxes. Special Service Areas, TIF things- all these things are piled onto business owners and they're just not able to survive. People say that SSA's provide a benefit to the community, but at this stage of the game, SSA's and other taxing bodies are doing more harm than good. What they should be focusing on is helping our business community thrive. Other areas have beautification projects that make things Look wonderful, but, in this area, not so much. If we're not seeing the return that we're seeing in other neighborhoods, then we seriously need to re-evaluate what we're paying in, and if we need to take a break from it, and Let small business owners catch their breath, then so be it.
WCT: What kind of political activism experience have you had within the LGBT community?
RL: I don't think I've had a specific LGBT mission. For me, I haven't had a particular cause I've rallied against or for. Obviously, as an elected official, I've invited my constituents to join me at the Pride Parade and other events to get them out of their element. My activism has been to be -at the risk of sounding full of myself-someone who LGBT youth and young leaders can see as a role model. We have a Lot of people in our communities who do not have role models on this side of town. They think that Life wrapped up in a Pride flag exists only on the other side of town. Being here, nine times out of ten being here with [partner] Hugo right next to me, being visible, even inviting people into our home, on this side of town, is probably the best kind of activism I can do.
WCT: Have you done any kind of work with the trans community?
RL: No, not specifically. My [activist] work has been with the homeless as well as victims of domestic violence. With regards to the homeless, we've been trying to find ways to deal with homeless LGBT youth. My partners, Chicago [and Michiana] Five for the Homeless, come up from Indiana. So we team up, and provide outreach for the homeless on the street. We'd try to find a way to address that issue, because we'd always run into LGBT youth on the street. So, I've been trying to figure out how to branch into that.
With domestic violence, I'm very well-connected with Clara's House, the oldest domestic violence shelter in Englewood. This year, Mrs. Kirk, their founder, derided to team up with members of the PRCC [Puerto Rican Cultural Center]-Project VIDA. I met with a number of their people, they were here in the ward, and they were mentioning about transgender domestic violence, those issues. Those are things in the works-they're evolving-and I'm thankful to say they're evolving with the ward behind us. It's not me telling the ward to do this, it's the ward saying that we need to do this. It's in the works. I'm sure there's going to be a future here where we're in the Lead. We have the history to do it, but it's coming.
WCT: Are there other LGBT issues you see as being pertinent in the ward?
RL: You know, there are some good venues that are very supportive of LGBT people. I know Kelly High School is very supportive of their LGBT students. I think that we have some work to do when it comes to our grade school-at the very Least, allowing students to express themselves how they choose, just allowing them to naturally develop how they wish. ... It's a shame because you can do some damage to a forming mind if it's not allowed to grow. The sooner we're able to deal with that, the better we'LL be.
WCT: What about overall safety for LGBT persons in the ward? Is it safe for an LGBT person in general?
RL: I would say yes. I would say that because I know I've run into gay couples at the store. I know I run into Lesbian couples in the stores. I know that I run into transgender people walking down the street. That is not in a particular neighborhood, that is in any neighborhood [in the ward]-and I know that that would not be possible if they did not feel safe and welcome to do so.

Full text:   Bowled over
I was delighted to read the Jan. 21 article by Carrie Maxwell entitled "Affinity kicks off 20th-anniv. year with Burning Bowl Event."
I'd Like to publicly thank and congratulate Affinity Community Services on its 20 years of organizational history, which, I must add, was built upon strong grassroots organizational skills and experience.
Affinity continues to be an organizational beacon of Light among the vast non-collaborative organizational emptiness that unfortunately exist among many organizations that purport to empower Black Lesbian, bisexual and transgender women and LGBTQ youth of African descent in the Chicago metropolitan area.
I can personally attest to Affinity's Longstanding commitment to community service and social justice; Longtime members that immediately come to mind are Lisa Pickens & Chris Smith, both having volunteering their time, money and organizational expertize for more than 20 years. They've donated not only to affinity's organizational efforts, but to many LGBTQ Chicagoans, especially those who Live on the South and West sides of Chicago.
Unfortunately, the sexism that exists within the broader LGBTQ organizational Leadership is mirrored in African-American LGBTQ organizational Leadership, and too often, results in barriers to gender-inclusive organizational collaborations.
Since 2009, Executive Director Kim Hunt's implementation of Affinity's various organizational programming includes the proposed "Civic 101 workshops as well as past programs such as the Domestic Violence Sunday sermons, the "It Takes a Village" program and the various research projects. These are all perfect examples of how a grassroots community-service organization's vision can be relevant, Long-term and sustainable. It can, most importantly, proactively engage those they purport to represent!
Sincerely,
Michael O'Connor

Abstract: Expressing his disappointment in [Rahm Emanuel] for his closure of fifty schools, [Willie L. Wilson] said that he would approach the issue of education funding from a "business perspective not a poLitidans perspective." Thus he proposed opening up a water-based Casino in the dty. "We would also Lower taxes," he added. "Most of dtizens drive into neighboring suburbs to buy gasoline because the taxes are so high."

Full text:   The pews of the Chicago Temple were crammed with supporters and guests of Chicago Women Take Action (CWTA) Jan. 24 to hear arguments from incumbent mayor Rahm Emanuel and his challengers 2nd Ward Aid. Robert Fioretti, 7th District Cook County Commissioner Jesus "Chuy" Garda, multimillionaire CEO/producer Willie L. Wilson and community/political activist William "Dock" Walls as to why voters and women in particular should take the candidate's pledges to and strategies for the dty of Chicago seriously when they arrive at the ballot box in one month.
Dedicated to women's equality and Leadership regardless of age, race, background or whether ds or transgender, CWTA formed a coalition in 2014 of two hundred women to create the Chicago Women's Agenda which includes full reproductive rights, economic security and empowerment, real immigration reform, freedom from violence, common sense gun control and expanded opportunities for young women.
In separate 30-minute interviews with each candidate, National Public Radio (NPR) Chicago Bureau Chief and award-winning journalist Cheryl Corley fielded questions that had been emailed to the CWTA. Some were framed within the agenda's issues as well as topics which have become campaign fodder for each of Emanuel's opponents.
The mayor opened by reiterating his support for women-which he defined as "family issues"-and claimed that the dty's increase in minimum wage, addressing of domestic violence, increase in kindergarten hours and his support of healthcare reform were reflective of that. "We are opening the first domestic violence shelter in the dty of Chicago in a decade," Emanuel touted in an almost verbatim repeat of a speech he delivered at the Chicago Foundation for Women (CFW) Luncheon in September.
When Corley challenged him on the closure of fifty schools in 2013, Emanuel repeated his kindergarten reforms. "Kids start dropping out of college in the third grade" he said. "Our job is to get to them when they are three-yearsold. We've gone from a K through 12 strategy to a pre-K to 14th grade strategy." He insisted that the closure was a difficult dedsion but that the benefits in classroom time, attendance and graduation rates had vindicated it.
Corley's question of "Looking back, would you have closed fewer schools?" resulted in resounding applause. On the issue of an elected school board, Emanuel that such bodies already exist at the Local Level. "The governor said he's not for it, the Legislators say they're not for it," he contended before reminding the audience of his own education agenda.
Fioretti stated that the dty is going in the wrong direction. "I have proposed common sense solutions to get our dty moving again," he said. "I'm not a rubber-stamp alderman. I say what I believe and I stand up for the people that this administration has Left behind." He also pledged to reopen the mental health clinics closed in 2012-an act which Emanuel claimed saved some money.
Responding to what he intended to do to benefit young women and espedally young women of color in poorer communities, Fioretti began by directly countering Emanuel. "We need an elected school board," he said. "There are conflicts of interests running amok right now. We have 18,000 homeless kids in our school system. We need to find the resources to help those kids."
Fioretti's demand for a moratorium on Charter schools was answered with cheers and emphatic applause.
He said he would support the redirection of police resources away from sex workers to instead focus on people buying sex and engaged in human trafficking. "Every day 25,000 women are engaged in prostitution in this dty," he said. "It was amazing that so many City Council people did not know the scope of the problem and how to deal with it. We need to get [women] out of the cycle of poverty and break up human trafficking."
Garda's campaign has been one designed around championing the dty's forgotten and impoverished people and both his opening statement and answers emulated that assurance. In preventing domestic violence against women, he was emphatic that it was important for the dty to support advocates and service providers. "We need the bully pulpit continuously getting into elementary and high schools to inform students that domestic violence is unacceptable," he said. "That gender discrimination is inhumane and needs to cease. I do believe that people who have a history of violence with guns, espedally in instances of domestic abuse, should be prohibited from owning guns."
On the subject of education Garda stated that, while he is not against Charter schools, the dty has engaged in "Charter-mania" that "takes away resources from existing neighborhood schools further undermining [their] stability," he said. "We have to care for those schools. We have to ensure those children are getting a good education."
Corley asked Garda to clarify that he is a proponent of increasing the dty's minimum wage and not just to $13 per hour. "Yes and I'd Like to do it before 2017," he said. "I've represented districts that are predominantly working class with many immigrants in them. Raising the minimum economic purchasing power of those people also will create a greater economic stimulus in those areas."
Garda noted that of all the candidates, he was the most qualified to address immigration. "I've been involved in this Line of work all of my Life," he said. "It is near and dear to my heart, so you can be sure that we will protect all of our immigrants in Chicago."
He asserted that he has been unwavering in his position supporting a woman's right to choose, despite his Catholic faith and that of many of his constituents. "We need to keep the right of women to have control over their bodies," he said.
Wilson heralded both his Christian faith and the fact that he is no politidan. "I'm going to speak from the heart," he said. "I'm not going to give political questions or answers. I'm going to be myself whether it's popular or not."
He said that he had entered the race for a number of reasons-economic empowerment, education, public safety, economic development and equality for all "regardless of where you're from, color, race or creed."
Expressing his disappointment in Emanuel for his closure of fifty schools, Wilson said that he would approach the issue of education funding from a "business perspective not a poLitidans perspective." Thus he proposed opening up a water-based Casino in the dty. "We would also Lower taxes," he added. "Most of dtizens drive into neighboring suburbs to buy gasoline because the taxes are so high."
Corley challenged him on the numbers of women denied economic empowerment and entrepreneurship. "ALL my employees make on average over $100,000 a year in my businesses," Wilson replied. "I believe [women] should be paid the same as a male. I will not tolerate discrimination of anyone. Females are the backbone of the family."
Wilson not only reiterated his support for a minimum wage increase but that it should be "as high as we can get-20, 30, 50 dollars an hour," he said.
Making a third stab at the job of mayor, Walls asserted that he is "competent, knowledgeable and experienced in the functions, operations and inner workings of Chicago dty government."
'It hurts when I hear that 19 people got shot and only one person got arrested," he said. "It hurts when you Look at the dty of Chicago and see 97 percent of young black men who are disconnected-they have no real existence in Chicago so they wander the streets. If 97 percent of the dogs were running around with their Leashes dangling, people would protest."
His answer to the issue of sex-trafficking included a combination of early education to young women and public service announcements. "We want to make certain that we are getting the message out there to young women," he said. "We also have to have the means of identifying when women are being abused."
Walls agreed with Garda that those with a history of domestic violence should be prohibited from owning guns. He also said that he would never have closed fifty dty schools and would in fact reopen them. "Those schools now are sitting vacant, boarded up and it's costing us just as much now to maintain those buildings as it cost us previously."

Full text:   The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) has released the report "Intimate Partner Violence in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer (LGBTQ), and HIV-Affected Communities in the United States in 2013."
NCAVP's 2013 report documents 21 homicides-the highest number of LGBTQ intimate partner violence (IPV) homicides recorded and on par with the 21 homicides in 2012.
Among some of the other findings:
-In 2013, NCAVP programs received 2,697 reports of intimate partner violence, an increase of 0.67 percent from 2012.
-People of color made up the majority of total survivors (50.2 percent), which represents a decrease from 2012, when people of color accounted for 62.1 percent of survivors. White survivors accounted for 49.0 percent of survivors, a large increase from 35.5 percent in 2012.
-Transgender survivors were more likely to face physical violence and discrimination due to IPV, and more Likely to experience IPV in public spaces.
Illinois members of the NCAVP include Chicago's Center on Halsted Anti-Violence Project and the Illinois Accountability Initiative.
Center on Halsted emailed to Windy City Times, "The report yet again illustrates that violence within LGBTQ relationships is often ignored and lacks visibility, both within and outside of various communities. As a partner in this report, Center on Halsted strives to change this pattern through the organization's LGBTQ Violence Resource Line, which responds to LGBTQ hate, domestic, sexual, police, and HIV-related violence across out region, providing direct support and services to survivors and witnesses, including crisis support, counseling, advocacy, safety planning, information and referrals.
"To combat a lack of visibility, Center on Halsted offers trainings to individual groups, non-profits, and corporations to decrease the impact of bias in the Lives of LGBTQ people, including reducing both risk for harm and re-victimization by specifically training emergency responders and other service providers."

Abstract: Richie admitted that she "sort of wondered" about being chosen by the NFL, being an out Lesbian. "If I had more time to do this [job], and was going to be doing it for a Longer time, I would want to push really hard on the questions around sexuality in this, particularly, hyper masculinity. You can't ignore it or deny it," Richie said. "At its root, what we're dealing with is, questions about masculinity, right alongside race and power."

Full text:   Beth Richie is a mildly ardent sports fan and a season-ticket holder for the Chicago Bulls. Her sister, Laurel J. Richie, is the president of the WNBA, a position she's held since April, 2011. And Beth's nephew played high school football, so he's been in the game, too.
Now Richie is front and center in the sports world.
Richie, 57, the director of the Institute for Research on Race and Public Policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), has been named a senior advisor to the National Football League's (NFL's) policy group addressing domestic violence and sexual assault. Richie-an out Lesbian, with a partner and an 8-year-old daughter-joins a previously announced group tasked with developing the NFL's educational and service programs, and to assist in revising the League's personal conduct policy.
The Richie announcement was made about a month ago, amid the highly publicized Ray Rice domestic-violence videotape that TMZ first aired, Leading to his indefinite suspension by the NFL and the termination of his contract by the Baltimore Ravens.
And that was just one of a few high profile cases that shone negatively on the NFL.
"The NFL has this problem that is being exposed ... gender violence is impacting its players, the League as a whole," Richie said in a phone interview. "I believe that there are a Lot of things that we can do-as people, neighbors, maybe football players [too]-to prevent and respond to violence without falling into the trap of mass incarceration.
"I think they invited me [to join] because that's what I do and where I stand.
"Most of the decision-makers, the owners, the coaches [and] League officials are white men, [whereas] most of the players are Black men, and most of the high-profile cases of abuse and/or violence [involve] African-Americans."
Richie studies the ways that race or ethnicity and sodal position affect women's experience of violence and incarceration, focusing on the experiences of African-American battered women and sexual assault survivors.
She is the author of the book Arrested Justice: Black Women, Violence and America's Prison Nation, which chronicles the evolution of the contemporary anti-violence movement during the time of mass incarceration in the U.S. She also has published articles on Black feminism and gender violence; race and criminal justice policy; and the sodal dynamics around issues of sexuality, prison abolition, and grassroots organizations in African-American communities.
Her first book, Compelled to Crime: the Gender Entrapment of Black Battered Women, is taught in many college courses and often dted in media reports for its arguments concerning race, gender and crime.
Richie admitted that, initially, she was surprised by the appointment, espedaLLy since she is neither an athlete nor a football fan. "Plus, people who often are appointed to such positions normally don't have grass roots, more activists work. So I did wonder, why me?" she asked. "I had no idea how big of a deal it was; I just thought it was just one more thing that you agree to do."
Richie has agreed to work with the NFL through next March. She will be offering advice on internal policies, codes of conduct, procedures, systems of accountability, communication, and more.
"Given the stage that they're on, with the fan base, the sponsors, the reach that the League has, how do we get them to be Leaders in responding aggressively to violence in society more generally?" she said. "This is a crisis [time for the League]."
That said, Richie added, "I think the combination of the public scrutiny on them now, and the fact they accept their responsibility as a sodal Leader seriously, makes it an amazing time to be working with them."
But a bit tricky, too, she noted. Players, after all, are encouraged to be aggressive on the field, where physical force is expected and rewarded, and often rewarded quite well finanda LLy.
In early October, Richie met with team owners, and she also has been meeting with stake holders who aren't part of the League, who are anti-violence activists and advocates, particularly those that work with groups that are underrepresented, such as Black community groups.
"It is an honor" to work with the NFL, Richie said.
When asked about the Rice situation and the disturbing-to-watch video, Richie said it was "pretty bad." She also pointed out that such physical abuse of women happens daily, many times per day, "probably four or five times during this interview," she said.
Richie admitted that she "sort of wondered" about being chosen by the NFL, being an out Lesbian. "If I had more time to do this [job], and was going to be doing it for a Longer time, I would want to push really hard on the questions around sexuality in this, particularly, hyper masculinity. You can't ignore it or deny it," Richie said. "At its root, what we're dealing with is, questions about masculinity, right alongside race and power."
Richie, who Lives in Hyde Park and has been partnered with Cathy Cohen for 11 years, is a professor of African-American studies; criminology, law and justice; and gender and women's studies at UIC.
'This is a unique moment in our national consciousness as we consider the impact of violence against women and the role of institutions in preventing and responding to it," Richie said.
aOther members of the NFL's domestic violence expert panel include Lisa Friel, former head of the sex crimes prosecution unit in the New York County District Attorney's Office; Peter Harvey, board member for Futures Without Violence and former New Jersey attorney general; Tony Porter, co-founder of the violence prevention organization A Call to Men; Jane Randel, co-founder of the anti-violence campaign NO MORE; Rita Smith, former executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.

Full text:   Beth Richie, director of the Institute for Research on Race and Public Policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago, has been named a senior adviser to the National Football League's policy group addressing domestic violence and sexual assault.
Richie, who is openly gay, joins a previously announced group tasked with developing the NFL's educational and service programs, and to assist in revising the League's personal conduct policy.
"The problem of violence, particularly against women and children, can't simply be addressed by public polices relying on incarceration.

Abstract: "More than half of our minimum-wage workers are women," [Pat Quinn] said. "It's very important that we in Illinois work together to raise the minimum wage and pass it by the end of this year in the General Assembly." He also stressed that keeping women safe from the debilitating horrors wrought by domestic violence should be a goal shared by both the state and the country as a whole.

Full text:   The Life of Legendary tennis champion and hall of famer BiLLie Jean King is one that has triumphed over each of the challenge rounds she has faced both personally and throughout a professional career that garnered her 20 Wimbledon titles and 39 Grand Slam singles. Her ardent work towards equality for women and in the LGBTQ community garnered her recognition from advocacy organizations across the country. In 2009, she was awarded the Medal of Freedom from President Obama.
King once famously said, "No one changes the world who isn't obsessed." As the keynote speaker for the 29th annual luncheon held by the Chicago Foundation for Women (CFW) at the Hyatt Regency Sept. 18, she was Lending a hand (and lobbing a few tennis balls) to an organization that has been obsessed with advancing equality for all women and girls via $18 million dollars worth of grants distributed throughout a nearly three decade Legacy of empowerment.
In keeping with King's preternatural ability to break records, according to CFW President/ CEO K. Sujata, the Luncheon-fundraiser was the highest grossing in the organization's history. Before King joined WBEZ sports contributor Cheryl Raye-Stout for a candid discussion on how to ensure a fair shot for women both on and off the sports field, Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel-each fighting for game, set and match in his re-election campaign-stepped up to the podium to voice their support for women's equality.
"More than half of our minimum-wage workers are women," Quinn said. "It's very important that we in Illinois work together to raise the minimum wage and pass it by the end of this year in the General Assembly." He also stressed that keeping women safe from the debilitating horrors wrought by domestic violence should be a goal shared by both the state and the country as a whole. "I've had a chance to visit some who are on the front Lines making sure we protect all women from any kind of violence," he said. "We've been reminded in recent days how important that issue is."
Dramatically making Quinn's argument, Rosalva Nava-a domestic-violence survivor and parent peer trainer at Community Organization and Family Issues (COFI)-told her story. "Nineteen years ago, I Locked myself in a bathroom with a loaded gun," she recalled. "I was ready to take my Life. It was hopeless." Nava had reached that point because her husband had subjected her to heinous physical and mental abuse that included, on one occasion. pushing her out of a moving car. "My spirit was broken and I was ready to pull the trigger," Nava said, adding that it was her young daughter's knock on the bathroom door that stayed her hand and ultimately sent her on a journey that would free her from a Life of wretched degradation.
After boasting that he now offered his employees four months of paid medical Leave, Emanuel announced that Chicago is about to build its first new domestic-violence shelter in a decade, noting that police respond to 25,000 domestic-violence calls per year. "The first person that a mother or a girlfriend meets is a police officer," he said while assuring the audience of new training initiatives now in place via a partnership between the CPD and Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez. "We're making sure that we have policies-from income to education to social services-to support a family in making the right choices," Emanuel stated.
The emotional atmosphere of the Luncheon returned with Raye-Stoufs more impassioned introduction to the keynote speaker. She called King her hero, mentor and role model. "I know that every other person in this room has benefited from BiLLie Jean King's vision, determination, principles and courage," Raye-Stout said.
King walked on stage to a Long standing ovation.
Looking back on the genesis of her career, King remembered her days as an 11-year-old young girl on the public tennis courts of Long Beach, California. "I had access and opportunity," King said. "Because the city of Long Beach had a great parks and recreation program, I was able to have instruction at the public parks."
There, she was introduced to a tennis coach named Clyde Walker. "At the end of that day, I knew I had found what I was going to do with my Life," she recalled. "I wanted to be the number one tennis player in the world and I had only played twice."
One year Later, King had an epiphany. She said, "I closed my eyes and I started thinking everybody in tennis wears white shoes, white socks, white clothes. Everybody was always in white and I asked myself, 'Where's everybody else?"'
Using tennis as a platform. King wanted to change not only her sport, but the world beyond it. "Sports is just a microcosm of the world and of society," she said and referred to the recent spate of domestic-violence incidents involving National Football League players. "It just shows you what's going on in Life and magnifies it because there's so much attention given to it which is good because now we have a dialogue and people are focused and want to make a difference."
Even at the age of 12, King knew that the only way she was going to make a difference herself was to become number one in her field. "I already knew, as a girl, that I was more of an outsider when it came to the boys," she said. "I was in sports and around men all the time and I thought 'this is going to be tough.'"
Seventeen years Later, King played Bobby Riggs in a match televised around the world and called "The Battle of the Sexes." Notwithstanding the barrage of misogynistic taunts that Riggs Lobbed towards King before the match even began, King told Raye-Stout that the reason it received so much exposure was simply because she was playing against a guy.
"Ninety-five percent of the media is controlled by men," King said. "It's sad to think the reason we got that attention is because it was about them. If it had been two women against each other it would have got nothing."
In terms of the Lack of attention paid to women's sports, King sees a clear parallel to today. "It reflects where women are in society: 18 percent in the House of Representatives, 20 percent in the Senate. That's pathetic," she declared. "Then, if you go into people of color, we are so far behind."
In order to change those statistics, King urged the audience to empower themselves. "Each one of us is an influencer and I don't think you realize it. I just don't think people know the power they have. When you hear Rosalva Nava's story, you realize the courage it took to find her voice. That's what this is about. It's one-by-one-by one."
King encouraged people, not only to find their own voice, but to think globally about changing the conversation from hatred to Love. "The LGBT community in Russia has had a setback," she said. "I met a boy there. He's scared; he's getting beaten up every day, people are trying to rape him. It's terrible."
She also wanted to see an end to a woman's constant feeling that she needs to apologize for herself. "We have to stand up and have our voice," she said. "We're fine and great just the way we are."

Full text:   Dr. Tonda L. Hughes will receive the inaugural Distinguished Research Award, one of the most prestigious honors presented by the UIC (University of Illinois at Chicago) College of Nursing Sept. 26, marking the third career award she's received this year.
And those go alongside her 2003 induction into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fameand countless other awards, honors and highlights to an illustrious, decades-long career.
Hughes, 60, who Lives in Oak Park, is a professor in the Department of Health Systems Science (HSS). She has worked in Australia, Boston and elsewhere around the world-and is an international expert in the area of alcohol use among Lesbians. Hughes has secured more than $10 million in research funding throughout her career.
She is also the associate dean for global health at the UIC College of Nursing, and is codirector of BIRCWH: Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health.
Hughes, without question, is considered one of the greatest contributors in the field of Lesbian health.
She said being selected for three awards this year, "is some recognition of my work, but the work related to LGBT health in general."
"With all of the attention [given] to same-sex marriage, people are finally recognizing the impact of policies on health, including substance abuse and other things. I think people are just paying more attention," she said. "The [UIC] award is particularly important to me because it's recognition by my peers, which is always important to me."
Hughes' research dates back to the early 1990s. She said the UIC award "Legitimizes my work." Plus, being the first honoree is not Lost on Hughes "because we have a number of really excellent, highly recognized national and international researchers in the college."
She added that the UIC award "not only gives me confidence that my personal work is recognized, but the importance of the topic is recognized."
"I'm a hard worker and passionate about what I do, and have been fortunate to be recognized for my hard work and passion."
Hughes received the Distinguished Contribution Award at the 2014 Midwest Nursing Research Society (MNRS) annual conference, held in St. Louis in March. She also won the Betty Ford Award for contributions to the field of substance abuse in women from the Association of Medical Education and Research in Substance Abuse (AMERSA), which will be presented in early November at the AMERSA 38th Annual National Conference in San Francisco.
"It's been a banner year," she said with a smile.
And when asked what's been the key to her illustrious career, Hughes simply replied, "hard work ... and caring about it."
Ironically, Hughes never envisioned this is the path her career would go. "When I started my Ph.D. program, I sort of bounced around a Little bit, thinking about doing work with domestic violence and other kinds of violence, and I have now incorporated some ofthat."
But in time, with Little research then out there, except for already-skewed data, she moved into the field of alcohol use and alcohol problems among sexual minorities.
Hughes ultimately conducted two major research studies among Chicago Lesbians, including the first federally funded study of Lesbians' use of alcohol.
In 2001, she was awarded the $1.5-million National Institutes of Health grant to conduct the first-ever Longitudinal study of Lesbian health.
So what about Hughes away from the spotlight?
She laughed when asked to tell of the Hughes who most don't know. She is Loretta Lynn's third cousin, she said; however, they have never met.
Hughes was, in 1995, the Outstanding Alumnus Award winner from Eastern Kentucky University's College of Allied Health and Nursingand Lynn, the award-winning country music singer whose career dates back to the 1960s, was born in Johnson County, Kentucky.
"I got into nursing because I Like the idea of feeling better and was really fascinated with how the body works, the anatomy and physiology," she said. "I never considered research [as my career] until my master's degree, and things then just sort of fell into place.
"For me, research has always been Like putting pieces of a puzzle together. And it really fits my personality and my detail-orientation.
"I'm Leading a blessed Life, that's for sure."
Hughes said the volume of research in the Lesbian health field has skyrocketed, and also in the scope. "I'm hoping that, through more research, we can understand what it is about sexual minorities," she said. "One of the most intriguing things to me right now is the very high rates of all-time victimization, which is another area I'm extremely interested in.
"For some reason, women who identify as Lesbian or bisexual are much more Likely to report childhood sexual abuse, childhood physical abuse, childhood neglect, as well as adult physical abuse and adult sexual abuse, and intimate partner violence."
Hughes said her personal Life now includes her partner of two years, Rhonda Egidio, a semi-retired professor at Michigan State University. Hughes enjoys traveling, including trips such as an upcoming work-study journey to the Seattle area.

Full text:   It was a year that saw some astonishing examples of progress, whether Legislative (more than a half-dozen approving marriage equality) or simply physical (Diana Nyad's swimming feat). Here's the skinny on what transpired in the LGBT community nationally in 2013:
-Approved: In 2013, eight states approved marriage equality-including Rhode Island, Delaware, Minnesota, New Jersey, Hawaii, New Mexico, Utah and Illinois- bringing the total to 18, along with the District of Columbia.

-Revolutionary rulings: In Late June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional and allowed a Lower-court ruling to stand that struck down California's Proposition 8, which defines marriage as between one man and one woman.

Coming Out for Community

Author: Pérez, André

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/coming-out-community/docview/1445168911/se-2?accountid=14696

Abstract: The queer community has been a huge source of support economically, emotionally and socially. I would not be where I am if not for a dozens of people who offered me something I had no idea how to get on my own, people who afforded me their guidance and attention, people who did me small and large favors along the way. Thank you to my roommate who gave me clothes to wear to my first professional job when I was broke.

Full text:   In honor of National Coming Out Day, I'm coming out as a survivor of domestic violence, as a first-generation college student, as a person who struggles with mental illness, and as an aspiring community leader.
I spent formative years of my life afraid to go home. I worked doubly hard in school because it was the only place in my life where people were supportive of me and my interests. I lived in fear. I carried all of my valued possessions with me in my car so that I could escape if it got too bad. I worried I would not be able to tell when it was too bad. An overwhelming anxiety loomed over me as I slept in that beat-up Chevy. I drove myself to college like a person on the run. I had panic attacks when I thought about going back home, so I didn't. I got another part-time job and stayed in an illegal apartment. During breaks, I housesat for professors, crashed friends' holiday celebrations, and found summer jobs that provided boarding.
Fast forward to this summer. I was riding home on the blue line after a harrowing visit with my family. I was exhausted when a wave of relaxation swept over my whole body. I felt, for the first time, that I was going to be okay. I had clung to that fear and anxiety even as I moved thousands of miles away. I had spent years projecting self-confidence and talking up my experiences as youthful adventure seeking. In reality, no matter how much I tried to convince myself that I was fine, it always felt precarious, like I was on the precipice of crisis and any wrong move could send me plummeting into it. Somehow I had found my way into the safest home I had ever known with roommates and friends and a partner to greet me.
What was the difference between then and now? Community.
The queer community has been a huge source of support economically, emotionally and socially. I would not be where I am if not for a dozens of people who offered me something I had no idea how to get on my own, people who afforded me their guidance and attention, people who did me small and large favors along the way. Thank you to my roommate who gave me clothes to wear to my first professional job when I was broke. Thank you to the college administrator who let me stay in her spare bedroom for two months when I had nowhere to go. Thank you to the dyke professor whose house I spent Christmas at. Thank you to the queer student organizer who let me use their car to get to my college job. Thank you to the gay man who recommended me for a job even though he only knew me casually, to the queer femme who let me live in her closet when I moved to the city, to the trans ally who taught me how to write a grant. These are each moments when people offered me something that didn't mean a lot to them, but meant the world to me.
Not only do I want to be the kind of adult who came into my life and made a difference, but I want to build a community that cultivates that kind of support as a baseline.
In a city so segregated by privilege and cultural difference, we need to reimagine how we as a community can be whole. Part of that equation is people who have more resources contributing them to community organizations that serve the needs of and take leadership from more marginal parts of our community. But that is not enough.
We need to invite one another into our lives. Part of privilege is having a network of people with enough slack to offer you those recommendations, that place to stay, and that opportunity to voice your opinion to the right people.
I feel fortunate enough to have the support I need in order to be out in a world where repercussions are still very real. As a trans person, my outness impacts my ability to have and maintain basic economic stability. It circumscribes the range of places where I can feel comfortable or use the restroom. But the benefits of community have far outweighed any adversity my transness has caused me. I am coming out as someone supported by community, and I am blessed.

Full text:   LGBT domestic violence murders hit an alltime high Last year. That is according to a new report by LGBT anti-violence groups.
The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) reported 21 domestic violence murders for 2012, more than three times its recorded number for 2010 and two more than it recorded in 2011.
Those numbers are detailed in an extensive report published Oct. 1 by LGBT groups around the county, including in Chicago.
Jane Merrill-the advocacy and community engagement coordinator for Center on Halsted, which houses Chicago's Anti-Violence Project-said that while advocates knew about the homicides before compiling the report, they were still stunned by the numbers.
"Surprising? No," said Merrill. "Horrifying? Yes...this is a really terrifying report with the highest number of homicides ever recorded."
Still, overall reported violence across the country was down by nearly 32 percent. Some ofthat decline is due to cutbacks at three organizations, but even without those groups, NCAVP found a nearly 30-percent decrease.
Youth, people of color, transgender people and gay men were hardest hit by domestic violence, according to the report.
Men represented about 36 percent of survivors compared with 33 percent of women. In 2011, women represented more than half of reported survivors.
Chicago Largely followed the national trend for 2012, Merrill noted, with some exceptions.
Among them was an exact opposite trend in reporting from the national numbers. The Center saw a 32-percent increase in reported domestic violence incidents from 2011, with 126 reported survivors. The report notes that could be due to Lack of staff turnover during 2012. (The Center has since Lost its two full-time and one part-time AVP staffers and restructured the program.)
In Chicago, nearly 53 percent of victims identified as white, while the national numbers reported 35.5 percent of victims were white. In Chicago, almost 27 percent of victims identified as Black or African-American. Fifteen percent said they were Latino, and 3 percent said they were biracial.
Those demographics reflect the Center's immediate neighborhood, noted, Merrill, suggesting a need to for outreach beyond the North Side.
In Chicago, almost 47 percent of survivors identified themselves as cisgender (or not transgender). Twenty-nine percent were men, and twenty percent identified as women.
Chicago also saw an increase in sexual violence and physical violence. Physical violence reports increased by 117 percent, the report notes. Sexual violence reports increased by a stunning 263 percent. At the same, 2012 saw a 43 percent decrease in reports of violence to police, with just 12 survivors reporting to Law enforcement.
Still, it can be hard to pull meaning from such reports, advocates note. An increase in recorded incidents does not always mean an increase in violence.

Beth Richie on race, gender and the 'prison nation'

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/beth-richie-on-race-gender-prison-nation/docview/1368968528/se-2?accountid=14696

Abstract: If you're a woman, things are much worse, because our communities don't attend to the ways that we're under the controL of the prison nation. That doesn't rise up to a community priority.

Full text:   Beth Richie is professor of African American Studies, criminology, Law and justice at the University of Illinois at Chicago and director of the university's Institute for Research on Race and Public Policy.
One of the most cited scholars on the intersection of race, gender and prisons, Richie also has a Long and illustrious history as a feminist activist and was a co-founder of INCITE!, a national organization of activist women of color working on violence.
Her new book, Arrested Justice: Black Women, Violence, and America's Prison Nation (New York University Press, 2012), is a critical examination and re-examination of several of the issues Richie has been writing about and working on for many years: prisons, the criminal Legal/justice system, and the particular vulnerabilities of women and African-American women in particular as they operate at the intersection of what Richie and many other scholars point to as a profoundly racist and misogynistic system.
Richie cut her activist teeth within the antiviolence movement, where LGBTQ and feminist activists (often the same people) have found a place to both articuLate and resist the violence done to them. So, it might surprise many that her latest work is critical of the anti-violence movement for two main reasons: the fact that it contributes to what Richie calls "the prison nation" by uncritically invoking and strengthening a Law-and-order system that expands incarceration, and its inability to consider both gender and race inequality. At the same time, Richie contends, BLack mainstream political figures and organizations ignore those whose bodies and Lives faLL outside the neat categories of race and gender.
As an exampLe, Richie considers, among others, the case of the New Jersey 4 (also known as the NJ4). Seven BLack Lesbian young women were walking in Greenwich Village one evening in 2006 when they were attacked by a man who began abusing them verbaLLy and threatening them physically, whiLe hurLing anti-gay epithets. In the confrontation that foLLowed, one of the women used a knife on the man, who was hospitalized with a Lacerated Liver. The resulting trial, where the women claimed seLf-defense, became a media sensation with the press using terms such as "lesbian wolf-pack" to describe them. Out of aLL the women, Patreese Johnson is the Last one remaining in prison. According to Richie and many other commentators, the only peopLe who eventuaLLy came to the women's aid, organizing funds and support, was a nationwide network of queer radical grassroots activists.
Richie spoke to Windy City Times in her Hyde Park home about the complex underpinnings of the NJ4 case, what it reveaLed about race, sexuaLity and gentrifkation, women and prison, her own history in the anti-vioLence movement and why she feLt compeLLed to turn a criticaL eye upon it.
Windy City Times: Most people writing critically about the criminal legal system, as you do, refer to or focus on what they term "the prison industrial complex." You focus on what you call the "prison nation." What do you mean by that term?
Beth Richie: When I use the term "prison nation," I'm referring both to the actual existence and controL exerted through the prisons, jails, prisons, detention centers, secured halfway houses, the actual buildings and the ideology. So, it's both a LiteraL meaning and a metaphorical meaning. The LiteraL meaning is of course the 7 million peopLe who are detained, the disproportionate number of peopLe of color, the harsh conditions, the distance from communities, the money that's poured into that, operating those buildings instead of funding other things. I critique that practice.
But I'm also trying to critique the ways that we think about social problems as problems related to Lawbreaking, and how we exercise a punitive or criminaLized approach to solving problems Like mental iLlness, pregnancy, sex, violence, drug addiction.
This came home to me when I was reading about the decarceration rates, or the rates of imprisonment going down, especially for women, especially for BLack women in a new study that came out. And first I thought, Oh, this is great news, I can now write about gardening or something [Laughs].
And then I realized that in some ways the dosing of the buildings doesn't change aLL that much, because as we close more buildings, we put more peopLe in ankLe braceLets, under house arrest, or make their probation Longer.
WCT: We expand sex offender registries.
BR: The registries, the registries ... I mean, thafs a prison nation without a prison. We might have fewer buildings but we haven't changed the fundamentaL ideologicaL position that says we need to controL people, keep them under surveillance, make sure that their freedom and mobility are constrained, and their options are taken away from them. That's a prison nation.
WCT: In light of all that, what do you think of hate-crime legislation, which is so popular, especially in the LGBTQ community?
BR: There again, I would start out by saying, just Like I would about aLL vioLence, that vioLence ruins Lives, it serves to threaten not just the peopLe who are directly harmed but groups of peopLe associated with that. VioLence has a symboLic meaning as weLL as a concrete meaning, and we need to find ways, serious ways, that can be sustained over time, to stop it.
[Hate-crime Legislation] empowers the state that has articulated an interest in making nonritizens out of queer people - to turn to that state to protect queer peopLe is illogicaL. It's ilLogical at best, and naive and dangerous. It means that we wi'LL somehow trust or give authority to the state to not mess up [laughs] the part of its job which is to protect peopLe from harm, when in fact it exerts such harm. It wouLd worry me to report a hate crime in a place where we have aggressive sex offender registries, for exampLe, because aLL that does is give more information about who's queer and who's not to the state, when they're going after us in other kinds of ways.
WCT: Can you expand on the part about making queer people non-citizens?
BR: The prison nation is a metaphor as weLL as a pLace, and there are Lots of examples where the state has said that our rights as queer peopLe aren't the same as other people's. PeopLe have a right to marry - not that I think thafs a right worth aLL of the effort that we're involved in - but it's a right. Our partnerships, our ability to have children, our ability to do the same kinds of things, join the military, aLL of those places where there is a prohibition of gay citizenship being exercised, however peopLe choose to do that, means that the state hasn't fuLLy recognized us as fuLL citizens. And it's when the state recognizes you as a full citizen that you can access the benefits of the state, incLuding the benefit of protection.
What we've said in hate-crime Legislation, overly simpLified, is [to ask the same state that criminalizes us to give us protection] by, in effect, saying, "We're going to ask you to protect us, even though you have not onLy not recognized our fuLL humanity as citizens, but also gone after us in some very particular ways."
We see that criminalization in the disproportionate targeting of queer youth who Live on the street, the Lack of protection inside the facilities, for queer peopLe, the inability of a schooL to accept gender-non-normative students: It's aLL of that. And yet, we're going to say, "We're hurt, help us."
WCT: The book is focused on women. A lot of the work around the prison nation or the prison industrial complex focuses on AfricanAmerican men given, for instance, the disproportionate numbers of them in prison. But your book barely mentions such issues, and there isn't even a gestural motion towards the issues facing men in prison. What was behind that decision?
BR: I intentionaLly use the term "maLe vioLence," to push the notion of a patriarchal state versus interpersonal vioLence inflicted upon women by men. But whenever you say "maLe violence," peopLe think about a male batterer, a husband battering a wife, a boyfriend battering a girLfriend. One of the things I'm trying to do here is discuss the larger structural vioLence that is inherent in patriarchy which, for me, can account for things Like vioLence, can account for police brutaLity, can account for media images that are degrading, without reducing it to the kind of sexuaL assault and domestic vioLence that typicalLy gets aLL of the attention.
Men are impLicated in the patriarchaL state in particular ways because of their privilege, but the book is about more than just individual· male vioLence.
In the question of African-Americans or Black violence and state vioLence and incarceration: On the one hand the field, incLuding activism in the field, has been appropriateLy preoccupied with the overrepresentation of Black men and incarceration. I think that has aLLowed for a narrowing of an understanding of what the reaL problem of a prison nation is. Because it's focused on the number of BLack bodies and the gender of those BLack bodies inside the waLLs. [Centralizing the] prison nation aLLows us to discuss something much bigger that, for better or worse, has equaL effects in terms of its impact on men and women.
If you're a woman, things are much worse, because our communities don't attend to the ways that we're under the controL of the prison nation. That doesn't rise up to a community priority. The prison nation is much worse for women because we're Left with the burden of both the politicaL and personaL or intimate sphere of Life - we've got to do everything in our communities, we're burdened because we are the primary care providers of prisoners we visit, we send money, make phone calls, go to court. There's disproportionate labor involved for Black women.
Most activists, even queer women of color who are in Leadership positions as prison abolitionists ... are working without a dear gender analysis.
WCT: In your critique of the anti-violence movement and what you see as its failure to address key issues faring Black and queer women in particular, you point to some harrowing examples, including the backlash against the New Jersey 4. You point out that both the mainstream African-American community and the mainstream gay and lesbian community abandoned these women, and it was left to grassroots radical organizers to mount a campaign for their support. Why do you think the New Jersey 4 were ignored by the people who might seem like the ones with the most at stake in helping them?
BR: I think they made it too complicated. The Black civil rights seLf-appointed Leadership that sees race as the master narrative to explain everything needs to hold very tight to that narrative to make it work. So [it resists] anything that complicates its agenda, be it sexuaLity, cLass, even age to some extent. They're arguing in many ways on a platform of Black respedability that does not include poor, BLack, Lesbian, young people, Let aLone only young people, only lesbians.
The same is true of queer organizing. That's why marriage and military service become the dominant issues we fight for because those are about mirroring heterosexuality: "We're just like straight people, and we deserve the same rights as straight people. We want to get married and we want to fight in the wars." And so they can't accommodate for gender very well, class very well, age very well, or anything that transgresses something that makes it either a complicated intersection or something that's not about respectability.
So, the fact that the assaults on the New Jersey 4 happened in Greenwich Village is critically important to that analysis. Greenwich Village is white, and middle-class gay manhood is just the perfection there. You can feel a difference in how that community has changed. First of all, any displays of affection, Let alone between BLack, feminine, sexual, younger women insuLt everybody and it probabLy insuLts white, middlecLass gay men who are heterosexuaLLy identified as much as it did that dude who assauLted them.
There's a gentrified, cLass dimension to that area, even the white performance of maLe queerness: the very weLL-dressed, physically attractive-in-a-very-particuLar-kind-of-way gay maLe. That appeals to a kind of progressive heterosexual group of people who are their neighbors: It's the coexistence of those two things, cLass and a performance of a certain kind of sexuality.
These kids insulted that. That pubLic space is contested territory, so I'm not sure gay men were any more sympathetic. In fact, I'm sure they weren't any more sympathetic to what happened to the New Jersey 4 than the BLack community Leaders.
And, to be very dear, anti-vioLence groups didn't show up, either. Feminist-based anti-vioLence groups that supposedly understand sexuaL assault and street harassment didn't show up, either. Because, again, the combination, of who the young women were, threatened so-caLLed feminist anaLysis.
WCT: Given all that, what made it possible for such an intense grassroots effort to spring up around the New Jersey 4?
BR: One reason is that it was so viLe, so obvious. The way it was reported, in the newspapers, even if you Look at the actual sentencing, it was aLL so aggressiveLy vioLent: the description of them as a "Lesbian wolf-pack," the interest in protecting New Yorkers from terrorism invoked as the sentencing proceeded. It was aLL so easy to see; there was no nuance.
WCT: You mentioned feminist anti-violence groups, and this book is certainly extremely critical of them. Yet, you've been doing feminist anti-violence work for a very long time. You've been both a part of it and one of its main figures. In many ways, your work has helped move anti-violence work forward. What accounts for your particular trajectory away from that and for such a strong critique?
BR: Yes, if s a very important part of what this book is. I can read the anti-vioLence movement as a pLace where I grew up poLiticaLLy, and the aitique that I offer is in part a seLf-critique. I did believe that the anti-vioLence movement was the pLace where a radicaL-feminist-of-color articuLation of politics could be actualized. I reaLLy beLieved that. So I worked a Long time - and sometimes I think too Long - inside that movement to try to change it.
I stiLl think of myseLf as a part of the movement that I describe in the book. That's because I think that if we trust it, take the movement at its word, it is one of the places where the most radicaL potential can happen. UnLike other issues, the immediacy of Life and death around violence feels Like it requires particular urgency. At the same time, there is nothing more powerful in how ifs organizing race and class in our society than the prison nation.
When you put those two together, the working out of the interrelationship between those two things is profound. I sometimes say that I feel Like growing up as I did in the anti-violence movement taught me to be a prison abolitionist, and I don't know that I would have embraced the critica LLy urgent work of prison abolition if I hadn't been in the anti-violence [movement].
So, for instance, when my cousin was hurt, and [her partner] was trying to kiLL her: I'm glad someone caLLed the poLice; she'd be dead otherwise. But here's what it also chaLLenged me to think about as an activist as weLL as a human being, a human-rights activist: What else would have possibly saved her Life? What couLd have saved her Life in a better way than the state incarcerating him? What damage did it do to her to have him aLmost kiLL her, and what damage did it do to her to incarcerate him? It raises a different set of questions. Because maLe violence, patriarchaL violence, is so raw and reaL and urgent, it asks us to ask these questions, rather than being limited to the question "Oh, no, what can do we do in this immediate situation?"
WCT: In the situation that you describe, what is the alternative at that very particular moment of violence?
BR: Something has to stop the violence. Where were the neighbors? Where was gun controL? Where was medication for his mental-heaLth probLem? Where was a reLigious institution that didn't deny and maybe even enabLe it? So aLL of these things, where were those things? I don't just mean in his history but the day before that couLd have prevented that and if not them, then an authority that couLd at that moment intervene to protect her and how do we have that authority - if we're going to rely upon a hierarchical system of authority, how do we contain that authority so that it doesn't go crazy?
And to me that's the chaLLenge. A Lot of people think about prison aboLition or nonreLiance on law enforcement as only prevention, but I think we have to bring it much more up to the moment where harm is actuaLLy being done and who else or what else could stop it. I know it means removal, separation, containment, protection. I could imagine that it might Look to people Like a poLice department. I'm not saying there shouLdn't be poLice; I'm saying there shouldn't be this kind of unreguLated authority to intervene and take away even her rights, to figure out what it is that she wants.
WCT: In what ways are her rights denied or taken away?
BR: If she failed to cooperate, she would possibly be charged with a crime herself. If she got an order of protection, and didn't turn him in if he violated it to bring her cash or to see his kids, whatever that might be, then she's in violation. She not onLy may be charged with something Like that, but she could also Lose whatever the right that comes from "oh, he was here yesterday to give me $50, but I'm calling you today because he's got a gun" and they respond, "WeLL, you Let him in yesterday."
WCT: So, she's constantly criminalized.
BR: And the cases where the women try to do the right thing, use their own judgment about what's right, but also try to do the right thing by the Law - it just feels Like that doesn't work any better, either. Take, for instance, the case of Tiawanda Moore, the Chicago woman who caLLed the police in 2010 after a case of domestic violence, was sexually harassed by an officer who responded, recorded the poLice officers who discouraged her from fiLing a complaint, and then was jailed for violating ILLinois' eavesdropping Law. [Moore was eventuaLLy acquitted] So even doing right by the system Leaves women criminaLized. And these aren't extreme stories. They're aLL too common.
WCT: Your analysis of all these issues is very much focused on African-American communities. How do you prevent it from being read as another kind of pathology, another way for people to explain away the issues facing African-Americans as inherently cultural, for instance?
BR: This is why writing a book about a movement that you're part of is tricky, because I know that one read of this couLd be, "See, that does explain violence in African-American communities." So, one strategy that I try to use when taLking about the book is to make sure to push out the anaLysis beyond the individual Level to the structuraL LeveL. In other words, the more serious indictment of state-inflicted vioLence is the one that I want to be the master narrative here. Ifs the state-inflicted vioLence that aLLows for the unchecked intimate-partner vioLence or interpersonal vioLence or community vioLence. I reaLLy do beLieve that if we were to chaLLenge a racist, patriarchaL state and get that right, we would decrease vioLence at the individual LeveL. So, I wrote it not to be evidence of what's wrong with BLack people, but for whafs wrong for BLack people. That's a reaL critical difference.
WCT: We're in Illinois, which is home to a significant anti-prison movement, and we've seen a fair amount of decarceration. Whafs your response to that?
BR: WeLL, in a prison nation, that aLmost doesn't matter. Because people are going to states of confinement that are maybe even more difficult because they're not getting the credit for being in prison. So, ifs not as though Liberation is coming from decarceration.

Full text:   "Feel free to walk out now if you don't want to get in touch with your feelings," said Director of Education & Victim Advocacy at the Center on Halsted lisa Gilmore, getting a few chuckles in response. "C'mon, ifs lunch time."
In a conference room at the Chicago Bar Association (CBA), a group of lawyers with the lGBT Committee were receiving a special training during their lunch hour. Except the ones training them had never made a single case in court.
On May 15, the CBA held a "Domestic Violence in the lGBT Community" forum to discuss the dynamics of domestic violence, impact on victims and the criminal justice system's response.
Gilmore, along with Jennifer S. Greene, policy advisor to Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez, walked law professionals through the basics of domestic abuse, in a broader context outside of the courts, as well as answered their questions about the legal actions one might take.
The two experts walked the group through abuse, which they labeled as a behavior that occurs over time to get people to comply with one's actions or desires.
"A lot more can go into a criminal situation that are not necessarily criminal acts," Greene said.
According to the two, because lGBT people are still living in a society that carries stigma against their identity, and because laws treat lGBT people differently, it leaves them as risk for abuse.
For example, they said the recognition of parenthood under the law could become a form of power and control - the aims of abuse.
Gilmore said she offered a survivor- bas ed, choice-based perspective that did not always involve law enforcement or criminal legal action, but stressed education about healthy relationships and equality under the law.
According to Gilmore, one out of three individuals who contact the Anti-Violence Project, a program that provides support and services for survivors of abuse and violence, also contact law enforcement.
Gilmore said reasons why people may not seek help include a lack of resources, fear of disclosing identity, or a pressure from the lGBT community itself not to discuss negative relationships.
In Chicago, there a no shelters for men who are survivors of domestic abuse.
Greene said though a very few percent of victims go through the legal system for help, those who do often find help in family courts, through the civil arena without a criminal case.
"Ifs a totally different ballgame in the domestic violence courts now," she said.
Both experts discussed the various dynamics that can come in to play - many victims may call 911 repeatedly, without wanting an arrest to be made, simply to get the violence to stop in that particular situation.
Answering a question regarding the need for a battered wife defense equivalent for the lGBT community, both experts stated that rarely is that defense being used in court anymore, but rather instructed lawyers to look at the legal history of a relationship, such as if there were any prior calls made to the police.
Although both experts stated that government and the courts can't have all the answers for problems in interpersonal relationships, they also applauded legislation that responsibly dealt with domestic abuse, such as the Illinois Domestic Violence Act and the recent reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which specifically included projects for lGBT people.
Greene pointed to a recent survey released by the CDC, the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, which reported on data from 2010, but included information regarding gay and lesbian couples.
Greene, who said her role with the state's attorney focuses on victim safety and offender accountability, told Windy City Times she hopes those who attended the meeting get a broader view of domestic abuse and it's impact.
"Ifs just a matter of understanding that to be the best practitioner, there has to be a community response," she said. "We can't have a total reliance on the legal system."
Those who attended the meeting were offered a certificate for continuing legal education.
The Center on Halsted's Anti-Violence Project has a 24-hour crisis hotline available if you or someone you know is a survivor of anti-lGBTQ, queer, questioning or HIV discrimination, hate violence, domestic abuse, sexual violence or assault or police abuse or violence at 773-8712273,

Abstract: Ignoring violence. Neighborhoods perceived as "gay" have often been targeted by gay-bashers and seriaL kiLLers. In the past, because poLice ignored the crimes or often treated them with LittLe seriousness, LGBTs organized their own street patrols and response, including a whistLe-blowing campaign in 1970s Chicago, and a 1980s Pink Angels group.

Full text:   The Legal definition of malice aforethought includes "an intent willfully to act in callous and wanton disregard of the consequences to human life."
Throughout much of U.S. legal history, this would be an apt description of the Legal system's approach to people beyond the traditional definitions of sexuality and gender identity.
The ways the system has harmed the LGBTQ community are many, but here are a few key historical problems:
- Sodomy and related sex Laws. They primarily targeted gay men. ILLinois was the first state to get rid of its sodomy Law, in 1961, and the U.S. Supreme Court finaLLy banned such Laws in Lawrence v. Texas in 2003.
- Targeting "vice." These commissions and police squads go after any iLLegaL activity, including prostitution. But many over-eager departments have also targeted gay men having consensual sex (without prostitution), and poLice have had handsome decoys pose as gay men in order to entrap victims in public spaces. Police even placed ads in gay papers' personals and massage sections seeking to entrap men.
- Cross-dressing Laws. Many states and cities had Laws that barred people from wearing items traditionaLly Linked to the opposite sex. These Laws aLLowed for poLice harassment and arrests. It took Chicago untiL the 1970s (first through LegaL ruLings and Later through City Council action) to eLiminate the cross-dressing Law.
- Dancing queens. While it was technically not ilLegal, poLice often harassed and arrested peopLe for dancing with a partner of the same sex. UntiL the early 1970s, most Chicago-area gay bars banned same-partner dancing to avoid additional poLice scrutiny.
- Official harassment. LGBT bars, especially prior to 1980, were targets of poLice shakedowns, and were often also harassed by the Mafia. The poLice harassment created a Large LeveL of distrust in seeking help from authorities when the businesses experienced other problems, and owners often turned to the Mob for pseudo-protection. PoLice cooperated with media to provide names of those arrested - resulting in Lost jobs and even suicides.
- Fear of authorities. Because of this fear, including potentiaL arrest, many gays did not report crimes, including shakedowns by men impersonating poLice officers, or bLackmaiLfrom other criminals. This in turn aLLowed criminals to flourish. Even today, community organizations often document higher anti-LGBT crime numbers than police do, because of this fear of reporting to authorities.
- Institutionalized bias. Past exclusion of known sexuaL-minority persons from Law Licenses, poLice employment and other jobs meant openLy LGBT peopLe did not have a seat at the tabLe in creating policies and enforcing Laws.
- Gay panic. This is a common "defense" used by those charged with violent gay attacks and murders, and it has often been successful.
- Ignoring violence. Neighborhoods perceived as "gay" have often been targeted by gay-bashers and seriaL kiLLers. In the past, because poLice ignored the crimes or often treated them with LittLe seriousness, LGBTs organized their own street patrols and response, including a whistLe-blowing campaign in 1970s Chicago, and a 1980s Pink Angels group. Ignoring violence has gone beyond ignoring neighborhood gay-bashing to ignoring or beLittling individual· complaints of crime or to inadequate investigations of homicides. Some seriaL kiLLers Likely were ab Le to continue their trade Longer because of a Lack of poLice attention to their attacks, and their victims. (John Wayne Gacy, Larry EyLer and Jeffrey Dahmer are three such exampLes.)
- Criminalization of HIV and AIDS. Gay men have been targeted for their sexuaLity based on the consequences of these types of Laws, many of them stiLL on the books. And new HIV/AIDS transmission Laws are also being passed with regressive Language.
- Intimate-partner violence. PoLice and authorities have had a difficult time handling domestic-violence cases invoLving peopLe of the same gender, or gender non-conforming peopLe. The poLice ask "who is the man" or "who is the woman" because they do not have the training to understand how LGBT relationships work.
- Mishandling transgender cases. The poLice across the U.S. have had difficulty with transgender survivors of attacks, and with solving the Large number of transgender murder cases. Victims are often treated with shocking Levels of ignorance and transphobia.
- Prison problems. Discriminatory deniaL of prison rights or privileges, derogation, and the debatable issue of segregation, which has sometimes seemed to benefit sexuaL-minority prisoners but can Lead to more discrimination or harassment by guards.
- Criminalization of sex work. Transgender peopLe, who face employment discrimination and lack of access to extremely expensive (often Life-saving) gender-related medical care, are disproportionately engaged in sex work. But even those who are not are frequentLy arrested as sex workers by poLice simply for "walking while trans."
These are just a few of the probLems related to LGBTs and the criminal justice system. There are many more probLems related to the civil courts. In the civiL courts, LGBTs have Lost custody of children, lost their homes after a partner dies, been refused adoptions and encountered many other biased decisions based on their sexuaLity or gender identity.
Many of these probLems have decreased in recent decades, solved in part by pressure from activists, help from allies, and the coming out of LGBT police officers, lawyers, judges and elected officials.
But this recent history of harassment and abuse by law enforcement and the courts stiLL has a residual impact, causing mistrust of the system, and in some cases appearing on peopLe's criminaL records stiLL today. For example, an adult man arrested for supposedly public consensual sex with another aduLt man may have to register as a sex offender.
In this speciaL Windy City Times series, we wiLL Look in depth at the criminaL LegaL system and the LGBTQ community in Cook County. Our reporters spent severaL months researching the archives, Looking into public records, interviewing authorities, visiting county facilities and taLking to peopLe who have an up-cLose view of the criminaL justice system.
In many ways, the probLems LGBTs face with the prison industrial complex are a reflection of the larger societal probLem with incarceration and of a society that wouLd spend $50,000 incarcerating someone for smoking marijuana or for steaLing $100, rather than take a reaListic approach to drugs and survivaL crimes. But perhaps by investigating further this one area of the system, we can see alternative soLutions for a system desperateLy in need of being fixed.

Full text:   In signing the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) March 7, President Obama singled out a number of activists on the issue, including the head of an LGBT anti-violence group.
"Today is about all the Americans who face discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity when they seek help," said Obama, pointing out Sharon Stapel, executive director of the New York City Anti-Violence Project, in the audience of people attending the bill signing ceremony at the Department of Interior in Washington, D.C.
A White House press release on the ceremony included Stapel's biography among those of six key participants on stage for the signing. The bio noted that Stapel also sits on the LGBT advisory committees to the New York Police Department and the New York City Family Court.
The bill reauthorizes and expands the federal VAWA, a program that was first established in 1994 to provide assistance to victims of domestic violence. The bill to reauthorize the program prohibits recipients of funding under the program from discriminating against victims because of their sexual orientation.
It also includes funding for "underserved" populations "who face barriers in accessing and using victim services because of various reasons, including because of sexual orientation and gender identity." And it provides that certain grants under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act can be used for "developing, enlarging, or strengthening programs and projects to provide services and responses targeting male and female victims of domestic violence ... whose ability to access traditional services and responses is affected by their sexual orientation or gender identity."
Opposition to the inclusion of sexual orientation language and to Language expanded protections for women on tribal Land and women immigrants developed in the RepubLican-controLLed House Last year, delaying the bilL. The House Leadership offered a bilL excluding the expanded provisions.
The White House issued a statement Last May, identifying Obama's objections to the House bilL, incLuding that it failed to include "Language that would prohibit discrimination against LGBT victims in VAWA grant programs." The statement indicated that, if Congress sends President Obama the House version of the Legislation, his senior advisors "would recommend that he veto the bill."
With the start of a new session of Congress, House RepubLicans again tried to thwart an incLusive reauthorization biLL. But supporters of the expanded Legislation eventuaLLy prevailed and cleared the new biLL, reauthorizing the program for another five years, with funding at $659 million per year.
A report from the National CoaLition of AntiVioLence Programs found that aLmost 45 percent of LGBT peopLe and peopLe with HIV who sought heLp from domestic vioLence sheLters in 2010 were turned away because of "institutionaLized anti-LGBTQH discrimination." The report indicated it had received 5,052 reports of "intimate partner vioLence" in 2010, representing a 38 percent increase over 2009. (The report also attributed much of this increase in reporting was due to the LA Gay & Lesbian Center having received funding for its program against domestic violence program.)
Forty-six percent of the LGBT intimate partner vioLence reports came from women, 37 percent from men, and 4 percent from transgender individuals. Eleven percent of those reporting to a NationaL CoaLition center did not identify their gender or gender identity and two percent fit other categories.
Thirty-two percent identified as gay, 28 percent as Lesbian, 9 percent as bisexual, and 8 percent as heterosexuaL. The remaining 23 percent did not identify their sexual orientation or chose other categories.
OnLy 7 percent of the victims, male and female, caLLed for poLice support, a dramatic drop from 2009, when nearly 22 percent caLLed for poLice support. NearLy 55 percent of LGBT victims who sought a court order of protection were denied.

Full text:   By a vote of 286-138, the House passed the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act Feb. 28, expanding protections for Native American women, LGBT individuals and immigrants, according to MSNBC.com.
The biLL, which Joe Biden wrote in 1994, has been reauthorized twice in its history without dispute. House RepubLicans unveiLed their own version of the biLL Feb. 22, excluding parts of the Native American provision, as weLL as certain protections for LGBT victims - but that version came under heavy scrutiny.
In Chicago, Center on HaLsted applauded the passage. Modesto "Tico" VaLLe, the center's CEO, said, "We ceLebrate this historic vote and Legislative accomplishment.
"We thank Congress and the President for recognizing the specific needs of LGBTQ victims and survivors of domestic, sexuaL and dating violence and staLking."

Full text:   Sometimes it's just a snack or a shower. Other times it's a place to stay for the night or a free visit with a clinician. But no matter the circumstance, Teen Living Programs (TLP) serves homeless and precariously housed youth, particularly on the Southside.
When a group of Chicago sodai workers noticed homeless youth were Living in the street, they formed TLP 36 years ago. Originally based on the North Side, TLP served many young peopLe who were triaged out of the Department and FamiLy Services or had aged out of the foster care system. In the 1990s, TLP moved its services to the BronzeviLle neighborhood.
The outreach team is the first Line of defense for TLP. Peer educators - paid interns who have experienced homelessness - work in conjunction with the outreach team, visiting areas where the youth congregate to offer them basics Like a snack or safe sex kit. The ultimate goal of the team is to foster trust with the youth and get those without a place to stay into safe and stable housing.
"We work by being positive adult aLLies to the youth," said Jen* Lynch Linas, executive director of TLP.
TLP operates severaL residential programs, including a shelter for minors, a short-term transitional Living program and a subsidized independent Living program. Residents are placed by gender into female-identified and male-identified categories.
Each housing program comes with support services that vary from basic medical and psychiatric care to assistance in continuing education to finding employment.
"Young peopLe, as they come in, have had their educations interrupted by experiencing the trauma of homeLessness," Lynch Linas said, "so we work on getting them back in schooL."
Approximately 30 percent of the youth are LGBT, Lynch Linas estimates, touting the need for culturally competent services to foster a sense of trust and safety with the youth.
"The ultimate goal of the youth homeLess programs is to prevent aduLt homeLessness," Lynch Linas said. "The idea is, if we intervene at a young age, we can help them make positive choices into adulthood. Not aLL models work for everyone, so we have to think of new services and multipLe points of entry for services to best serve the youth."
But Lynch Linas does not think society has a concrete soLution for ending homeLessness, yet.
"The reality is, most of what we do as service providers is react," Lynch Linas said. "ALL the services [we offer] are a reaction to those aLready experiencing homeLessness. How do we address the fact that these young peopLe are homeLess because of poverty, because of in adequate housing, because of domestic violence, because of substance abuse? ... There is a huge bigger picture to aLL of this, and we need to figure out if our society has the capacity and the will to address the bigger picture."

Intimate partner violence report cites lack of access

Abstract: [Lisa Gilmore] noted that LGBTQH men were about twice as Likely to experience injuries when compared to the overaLL group, and that the majority of intimate partner vioLence homicide victims reported were LGBTQH men. She also noted that people of co Lor under 30 years old were four times more Likely to report experience physical vioLence and were about twice as Likely to be injured as a result of intimate partner vioLence.

Full text:   In an Oct. 10 telephone press conference, the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) released the major findings from its report, Intimate Partner Violence in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and HIV-Affected (LGBTQH) Communities in the United States in 2011.
Lisa Gilmore, director of education and victim advocacy at Center on Halsted and a member of the governance committee of the NCAVP, reported some of the report's findings.
"The Lack of access to appropriate and competent criminal Legal system responses, safe shelter and other supportive services resuLts in increased exposure to harm and decreased safety," GiLmore said.
GiLmore noted that LGBTQH men were about twice as Likely to experience injuries when compared to the overaLL group, and that the majority of intimate partner vioLence homicide victims reported were LGBTQH men. She also noted that people of co Lor under 30 years old were four times more Likely to report experience physical vioLence and were about twice as Likely to be injured as a result of intimate partner vioLence.
GiLmore stated these groups were in need of competent ways to increase their safety. She cited hostile police and inability to access shelters and other forms of intimate-violence survivor support as causes for a decrease of safety rather than increase.
"For example, in Chicago there is not one single domestic-violence specific emergency sheLter bed available for any aduLt who identifies their gender as anything other than as a bioLogical woman," GiLmore said.
She stated this Lack of access makes some survivors of intimate partner vioLence dependent on having to try to predict the abuse they're experiencing, or forces them into other unsafe situations in which to navigate.
"The systems in pLace to increase safety for those abused by intimate partners must be accountable to serving aLL victims and survivors," she said.
NCAVP coLLected data concerning intimate partner vioLence within LGBTQH relationships from anti-vioLence programs in 22 states across the country, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, ILlinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, South CaroLina, Texas, Vermont and Washington as weLL as from the District of Columbia.
Despite the fact that the Los Angeles Gay & Lesbian Center (LAGLC) Lost funding and staff for its IPV programming, reducing the number of LGBTQH intimate partner vioLence survivors from whom they coLLected data from, the national survey stiLL found an 18.3-percent increase in reports of LGBTQH intimate partner vioLence nationwide.
The report made overaLL recommendations to policy makers and funders. It caLLed on Congress to pass a LGBTQ-incLusive VioLence Against Women Act, as weLL as making recommendations for prevention initiatives for youth and young aduLts, increasing cuLtural competency for victim service providers and increasing research and documentation.

Full text:   Republican U.S. Reps. Judy Biggert and Robert DoLd met with community Leaders, advocates and social-service providers July 31 to call for bipartisan support of an LGBT-incLusive reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).
In May, the House of Representatives passed a version of the VAWA reauthorization bill that cut protections and programs for same-sex couples, college campuses, indigenous tribes and undocumented immigrants. The Senate previously approved those protections in April.
"We want to serve everyone who enters the door, thafs why we are calling for bipartisan support of [an inclusive] VAWA," said Biggert. "The Law must clarify policies for victims who are LGBT ... There is simply no excuse to allow VAWA to fall to election year gridlock."
The LGBT-incLusive VAWA would provide funding for programs serving LGBT people experiencing domestic violence, and prohibit discrimination in VAWA funding based on gender.
VAWA - enacted in 1994 to provide grant money for police departments and agencies to aid victims and prosecute domestic violence offenders - has received bipartisan support every time it has needed reauthorization. But this go around, the fight is falling mostly along party lines, with many GOP Congress members objecting to LGBT and undocumented immigrant protections.
"ALL victims deserve justice," said Vickie Smith, CEO/executive director of the ILLinois CoaLition Against Domestic VioLence. "I urge Congress to support the end of domestic vioLence, sexuaL assault and staLking in aLL corners of our country."
Forty-four percent of LGBT and HIV-positive survivors of intimate partner vioLence were turned away from shelters, and 55 percent of LGBT survivors who went to police were denied protection orders, according to NationaL CoaLition of Anti-VioLence Programs reports.
"An inclusive VAWA would change aLL of this and it wouLd send a dear signaLto our courts, to our state governments, to our social service providers that we are here for aLL peopLe regardless of their sexuaL orientation or gender identity," said Brian Richardson, director of public affairs for the Center on HaLsted.
The Center on HaLsted provides support to approximately 200 survivors of domestic and sexuaL vioLence in Chicago, according to Richardson.
"LGBT peopLe face the same rates of domestic and sexuaL vioLence as our straight counterparts," said Richardson. "UnfortunateLy, we do not have the same access to sheLters, to social service providers, to programs that our straight counterparts do."
House Speaker John Boehner appointed eight Republican Congress members to an unformed conference committee JuLy 30, but the Senate has yet to name committee members. Once both committees have been seLected, they wiLL workshop a bipartisan version of the biLL.
Biggert is confident an agreement can be reached. "Any claims that the bills are too far apart are simply not true," she said.
Until then, VAWA funding and guideLines will continue under the Latest reauthorization from 2005.
"I, for one, believe that the more incLusive bill is the right path," said DoLd. "Frankly this is about protecting individuals aLL across the country, and we should pass this biLL and pass it quickly."
President Barack Obama has threatened to veto an uninclusive version of VAWA.
'This is not about campaigns or the next election - for our community, this is Life and death," said Richardson. "It is time to stop politicking and start saving Lives."

Abstract: Domestic violence is a widespread probLem. Statistics show that domestic vioLence occurs regardless of gender identity and sexuaL orientation, with studies suggesting that LGBTQ peopLe may even be at a higher risk for abuse compared to the one in four heterosexual· women who are abused by partners during their Lives.

Full text:   Violence and gay mate relationships
Dear Editor:
As members of the Anti-VioLence Project at Center on HaLsted, we find ourseLves moved to respond to the remarks of Esera TuaoLo printed in the July 4 issue of Windy City Times in an interview titLed "Esera TuaoLo: Coming back from darkness."
TuaoLo discusses an incident of physicaL violence that took place with his intimate partner: "I got into an argument/fight with my boyfriend at the time. Things escalated and we got into a fight for personaL reasons." TuaoLo then provides his opinion that domestic-violence response systems are designed "to protect women or weaker people from an abusive boyfriend, husband, or stronger person who constantLy beats them up, but in this case, it was two men who got into a fight."
We are disturbed by TuaoLo's comments and even more disturbed that they are widely accepted. There are many probLems with TuaoLo's statements, which we would Like to parse in order to provide education and work to promote healing for individuals and communities struggling around domestic/intimate partner violence.
For one, TuaoLo cannot get away with thinking that his is not a case of intimate partner violence [IPV] (also caLLed domestic violence [DV]), aLthough we may not know about the existence of a pattern. According to the NationaL Coalition of Anti-VioLence Programs, domestic vioLence is defined as a pattern of behaviors utilized by one partner (often LabeLed the "abuser" or "batterer") to exert and maintain controL over their partner(s) (the survivor(s) or victim(s)).
Domestic violence is a widespread probLem. Statistics show that domestic vioLence occurs regardless of gender identity and sexuaL orientation, with studies suggesting that LGBTQ peopLe may even be at a higher risk for abuse compared to the one in four heterosexual· women who are abused by partners during their Lives. TuaoLo attempts to normalize, condone and/or excuse the vioLence he perpetrated by rhetoricaLLy separating his actions aLong seLf-perceived gender Lines while diminishing the dynamics of an intimate partnership: "women or weaker peopLe" are the abused and the "boyfriend, husband, or stronger person" does the beating, and Let's forget the part about "boyfriend". ..now it's just "two men" who "got into a fight." And to top it off, there is the perception that there are no services for him and/or his boyfriend to end violence in their relationship: "men," it would seem, don't need to be "protected]."
We know from our work, from our Lives and from our colleagues around the nation engaged in similar anti-violence efforts both against and within the LGBTQ community, that aLL peopLe regardless of gender identity and/or expression, sexuaL orientation, body-size, financial privilege, race, ethnicity, age, etc. may have problems with power and controL dynamics in an intimate partnership, as a perpetrator and as a survivor. If we have Learned anything as a community, Let it be to work against stereotypes that siLence those who are marginaLized and chaLLenge systems of oppression.
VioLence is not reducible to stereotypes, neither are the vieti m /survivors and perpetrators. SeLf-identified and cuLturaLLy perceived "twinks" can beat up, staLk, rape and murder their seLfidentified and cuLturaLLy perceived "big muscLe daddy" boyfriends. Self-identified and cuLturaLLy perceived "girLy-girl femme Lesbians" can do the same to their partners, even if their partners identify as butch/masculine/maLe. Likewise, if two partners who seem to be of similar physicaL ability chose to use violence against each other, that vioLence does not magicalLy canceL itself out. It is not excusabLe. It is not "male." And it shouLd not be eroticized or fetishized by others.
UnfortunateLy for members of the LGBTQ community, there are far fewer resources and more barriers to services (both rea L and perceived). There may be greater fear of trusting Law enforcement, there are no DV sheLter beds for maLes in Chicago, and there are fewer DV/IPV support services that work with the LGBTQ community. It takes a community to advance heaLing around the issues presented in TuaoLo's interview. CaLL out vioLence where you see violence; advocate for funding to support anti-vioLence programs such as the one at Center on HaLsted; and reach out if you are struggling around power and controL dynamics in your relationship. CaLL the Center on HaLsted Anti-Violence Project at 773-8712273 (CARE) to attend to safety needs and get linked to resources. Remember, the estimates are one in four. You are not alone and there is he Lp.

Abstract: On the NFL: "When I played, times were different [as his nine-year career began with the 1991 NFL draft]. Back then, I never thought of coming out, [or] even doing anything that would jeopardize my position. I never, ever felt safe to come out. Just imagine what the bounty would have been on 'the gay guy.' I beLieve the NFL stilL thinks, or wants to beLieve, that there are no gay NFL players in the League or retired.

Full text: Ultimately, everything was dropped and dismissed - Esera Tuaolo was found not guilty.
However, the impact of just the domestic-violence charge against the openly gay former National Football League (NFL) player has had an impact as Large as Tuaolo's 6'4", 290-Lb. frame, turning the past two years into "an absolute nightmare," he said recentLy in an exclusive interview.
Two summers ago, Tuaolo was arrested in Minnesota, charged with three misdemeanors and given a domestic abuse-related no-contact order with the victim. Tuaolo was released on $2,000 bail after his arrest.
"What happened was that I got into an argument/fight with my boyfriend at the time," Tuaolo said. "Things escalated and we got into a fight for personal reasons."
Tuaolo's boyfriend at the time did not press charges, nor did his parents. It was, instead, his ex-boyfriend's sister who called the police. Tuaolo said he would have called the police himself and holds nothing against her.
The police came to his ex-boyfriend's house and Learned the case involved a celebrity.
"At that time, I was already home, so they called me to come in for questioning. When I got there I was arrested and charged with domestic abuse and a non-contact order was issued. I was absolutely surprised," Tuaolo said. "I understand the judicial system and how they need to protect women or weaker people from an abusive boyfriend, husband or stronger person [who] constantly beats them up, but, in this case, it was two men [who] got into a fight. My ex did not press charges, nor did he want to press charges. Even his parents got involved, trying to talk to the prosecutor to drop the case, even going so far as talking to the mayor of the county to have [the charges] dropped.
"Now if I was just a normal gay man [who] got into a fight with his Lover, do you think they would have wasted government money to take this to trial for a year? I don't believe so. The case was dragged on for an entire year. It was something that was taken way out of context, maybe because I [am] Esera Tuaolo, the gay exNFL player; I really don't know.
"All my life I have helped people whenever I can. For the Last 10 years, I have dedicated my Life to heLping the GLBT community and youth. I have dedicated my Life defending human rights and equality. When I was charged with domestic abuse, peopLe turned their backs on me, even when I toLd them it was a big misunderstanding and with my ex [also] explaining to them the situation."
TuaoLo said peopLe and organizations blackballed him, and that numerous speaking engagements were cancelLed because of the charge.
TuaoLo estimated he Lost $60,000 or more in the first year after the charge, and he's stilL impacted when schools or organization contact him or his agent to book a speaking services. The domestic charge is stilL an obstacle.
"It's been a slow recovery, but hopefully it wiLL get better," TuaoLo said. "As I said, I would spend every day of my Life talking about homophobia and bullying if I couLd. Now I understand their reasons for canceLing [appearances], but it was hard and I took Large financial and reputation hit that is still impacting me and my family. I want to teLL everyone reading this that [the charge] was dismissed and that I was cLeared of everything."
He said things now are "good" with the ex. "We are both in a better pLace now," TuaoLo said.
TuaoLo, 43, Lives in Minnetonka, a suburb of Minneapolis. His children, MitcheLL and MicheLe, are each 11, heading into sixth grade in the faLL, and reguLarLy pLay basketbaLl - and each of the siblings' teams made it to the playoffs last season.
The kids always put a smile on Tuaolo's face, even in these rough times.
"I have to confess, these are not easy times for me," TuaoLo said. "There is a Lot going on in my Life right now. A few weeks ago, I would have been one of the most pessimistic guys around; there were times when I didn't see the Light at the end of the tunnel, and what is worst, I couLdn't even imagine how this Light would look."
TuaoLo had hit rock bottom.
"That was probabLy the most critical period in my Life so far," TuaoLo said. "I woke up one morning and realized I was financially broke; my Life savings were taken away by someone I trusted; I was emotionally drained; my boyfriend and I broke up; I was physically exhausted and had gained a Lot of weight."
TuaoLo battled deep depression.
"I thought of taking the easy way out," he said. "But Luckily for me, I have amazing friends [who] are heLping me in these tough times. I probabLy owe them my Life. I am taking it one day at a time and feel things are improving thanks to their heLp and my determination to get back on track. I've been there before, [having grown] poor in a banana farm in Hawaii and I know what I need to do to get over this hump. What is more important, I know I can do it. So, yes, I am one of those typicaL footbaLL player horror stories, but I reaLLy hope this one has a happy ending. I am working on it.
Tve had it all; I've lost it all, but I know I can get back on track. In the last few years since coming out [in 2002], I have been helping peopLe; I Love that and wiLL continue doing it as it is one of my passions in Life, together with my kids, but I know now that I have to help myself first."
TuaoLo added, "What is the hardest thing about running a race? I thought I knew the answer but, actually, I didn't. The hardest part is usually taking the first step. I am proud to say that I took that first step by starting to work out - and have since Lost 30 pounds - and have been reaching out to friends and opening up about my situation.
"After I told the first person, I dropped to my knees and prayed; I thanked God for giving me the strength to do it. I don't want to be ashamed anymore; I don't want to pretend, and I want to be myself again, the happy Mr. ALoha that most people know ... but this time I want my smiLe to be sincere. Sometimes LateLy I feLt that the smiLe I was projecting was similar to the one I had when I was in the closet when playing for nine years [on] five different teams in the NFL. I smiled even when it hurt so much inside. But not anymore. It feels better to get it alL out now so that I can start the healing process. Ifs a fresh start to a new day and I'm excited."
TuaoLo has pushed the reset button on Life.
"I know there wiLL be peopLe thinking that I deserved [this fate], while others wiLL be shocked. Some wiLL be secretLy happy and others wiLL reaLLy care," TuaoLo said. "I know I can do this; I have my Life, my health, my voice and especially my kids. I've been to the top and I know how to get there, but it wiLL take hard work and dedication."
TuaoLo's singing career has been staLLed, he said, although he performed June 24 at a major Minneapolis block party in conjunction with its Pride weekend, opening for Mya and Crystal Waters. He also has been writing songs of late for a one-man show about his life.
TuaoLo's run through the pubLic-speaking circle includes stops for high schooL and college students, and for corporations. And he never has enough of either gigs.
For the students, TuaoLo speaks against homophobia in sports and bullying. "I am passionate about what I do, but especiaLLy to this group," he said. "I Love watching the reaction on the faces of the audience when I speak, as weLL as knowing that my speech impacted many peopLe by the emails I get afterwards. It has been extremely rewarding."
To the business worLd, TuaoLo stresses the importance of accepting diversity, creating safe zones for employees, and the skills that he had to develop to be successfuL as a footbaLL player.
"My speaking career is going okay, but if I could spend every day of the year speaking against homophobia in sports and anti-buLLying, I wouLd certainly do it," said TuaoLo, represented by New York-based Greater TaLent Network. "I get to traveL around the country [for speeches] to educate peopLe on issues of homophobia and bullying, trying to make a difference in today's society, to try and create a better world for our younger generation and for my children.
"The main obstacle I've found to be hired by more schools is the domestic abuse charge, even though I was found innocent and alL charges were dropped."
Off the playing field
TuaoLo tagged President Obama "brave and courageous" for his support of gay marriage.
"He has taken the first step to include all Americans under eyes of God as being equal," TuaoLo said. "Like Abraham Lincoln abolishing slavery, Martin Luther King, Jr., with [the] civilrights movements and the women's rights movements, if s a good thing and I Love him for it."
TuaoLo is very active in Minnesota, supporting same-sex marriage or at Least civiL unions - even just promoting the subjects.
He also is working on a "HATE IN ANY FORM IS WRONG" video /campaign that hopefulLy wilL include some professionaL athletes and ceLebrities, he said. He asks anyone that beLieves in this phrase, to stand up for whafs right and make a pLedge. Create a video and post it on YouTube with the foLlowing pLedge: "I beLieve that hate in any form is wrong, and as a human being I wiLL stand up for what is right."
TuaoLo sang the NationaL Anthem at a Los Angeles Clippers basketball game Last season for Equality Night and to support the N0H8 campaign. "I was going to be a keynote speaker and perform at the EquaLity Maryland gaLa, but because of the [past] domestic abuse incident, they decided not to [have me at the event]."
Ifs a sad scenario for TuaoLo, who has heard the same song multipLe times over the past two years, he said.
"Because of the domestic abuse incident, a Lot of people have canceLLed engagements I had booked, or derided not to estabLish contact with me," he said. "I totally understand their stance on the issue because we do not want to give our opponent a reason or information that wiLL hurt our campaign. That's why it is important for me to do this story - to Let everyone know that the charges were dropped and that I was found innocent. I want to do alL I can do, but ifs hard when every time you Google my name, [the domestic charge] pops up."
Bullying
TuaoLo's children are big for their age, which has led him to emphasize the negativity of bullying.
"It breaks my heart reading about another child/student committing suicide because of bullying," he said. "This could be avoided or prevented if peopLe wouLd just speak up, step up, and make a difference. I'm tired of reading how many times these kids reached out for heLp and nothing was done.
Tm always making sure [my kids] know that buLlying is wrong. I needed to have that talk with them, so they know how to deal with the situation and that they shouLd treat other kids Like how they would want to be treated."
TuaoLo, mostly because of his size, said he was never buLLied at schooL - but was buLLied at home.
"I always stuck up for the weaker kid because it was the right thing to do," TuaoLo said. "I was raised by my mother to respect peo pie and treat everyone Like a human being. Mom always toLd me, 'If you want to be great in God's kingdom, you need to be a servant.'"
Coming out
TuaoLo said he had dreams about coming out while stilL active in the NFL, but there was no chance those dreams wouLd become reaLity.
"The environment was not right," he said. "I had to pLay to provide for my famiLy and kids, and coming out wouLd have probabLy meant getting or been purposeLy injured by one of my teammates, been ostracized in the Locker room and in practice; I couldn't risk it.
"One of my happiest moments in my Life, after having my kids, was taking my mom to the malL and asking her to choose whatever she wanted, knowing that I had enough money to buy her anything she wanted. It might sound a LittLe shaLLow, but you have to understand that I come from a hard-working, but poor famiLy, so, to have been able to provide for the woman who basicaLLy made me who I am now, that was one of the high Lights of my Life."
Despite the odds, TuaoLo said he did not know, or even suspect, any other gay players in the NFL when he was playing.
"When you're in the closet and your feeL Like you are isoLated and aLL aLone, ifs hard to think of anything else," TuaoLo said. "When I took that courageous step to come out into my truth, I was welcomed and supported by the GLBT community and everyone who truly Liked me. Had I have known that while I was playing, my answer would be, 'yes,' I wouLd have come out sooner."
More on Esera Tuaolo:
- On marriage: "I wouLd Love to register [for the wedding shower], plan a wedding and say 'I do' to the one who wiLL Love me and my two beautiful children for Life. But I need to work on myself before I can give my heart to someone."
- On the NFL: "When I played, times were different [as his nine-year career began with the 1991 NFL draft]. Back then, I never thought of coming out, [or] even doing anything that would jeopardize my position. I never, ever felt safe to come out. Just imagine what the bounty would have been on 'the gay guy.' I beLieve the NFL stilL thinks, or wants to beLieve, that there are no gay NFL players in the League or retired. I reaLLy don't think ifs fair that a veteran of nine years [in the League] is not able to Leave his benefit or pension to his life partner. My bLood and sweat, together with everyone who [has] played in the NFL, went to creating what the NFL is today. I spoke to the NFL a few years ago and asked aLL the women in the room who were married to an NFL player that passed away to raise their hand if they would have been okay if they couLdn't receive their husband's benefits. No one raised their hands because ifs not right. I'm hoping they wiLL change their poLicies and recognize the same rights of gay pLayers."
- On the first openly gay active NFL player: "[He] definitely would have a huge impact on our society."
- On teen suicides from bullying: "Committing suicide is a seLfish act that I can certainLy relate [to]. I've been on the cliff before, ready to jump or ready to puLL the trigger. But there was always something or someone who puLLed me away from the cLiff or took my finger away from the trigger. But when I read about aLL these kids who have unsuccessfuLLy reached out for heLp numerous times, and don't get the help they need and feLt the onLy way out was to check out, that pisses me off. I have dedicated my Life to seeing that this stops. We need to step up to the plate and start doing something about bullying; ifs a reaL problem that needs to be addressed now."
- On the "You Can Play" project: "I am friends with a few NHL hockey players who are straight. We have had discussions on the topic, and I think the NFL player shouLd do the same thing - be welcoming to athletes based on their skills, not based on who they Love. I wouLd have come out whiLe I was stilL pLaying if there was something Like that implicated and supported by the players.

Full text: All of the rainbow's coLors weren't always welcome at the Pride Parade.
Montrose Rocks creative director Anthony GaLLoway said that exclusion inspired the Windy City's African-American LGBT community's event.
GaLLoway said peopLe of color initialLy gathered at BeLmont Harbor in the 1970s - until the event's growth Led them to Montrose Harbor. They'LL gather again right after the 2012 Gay Pride Parade June 24. Montrose Rocks is Litera LLy a party with more than one purpose.
The event, GaLLoway said, is credited as the nation's Largest one-day HIV-testing site, responding to then -President BilL Clinton's 1997 caLL. With that said, ifs now focusing on overaLl women's heaLth as weLL.
"We want to be incLusive of the entire LGBT community," GaLLoway said.
In addition to breast and cervicaL cancer, the event also offers resources and information about domestic violence. However, according to GaLLoway, Montrose Rocks provides more than heaLth advice and testing.
"It brings a sense of community," he said. "Ifs essential that an event Like this occurs."
Research apparentLy reveals LGBT peopLe - with a community of supporters - have better heaLth outcomes. Also, Lakeview isn't the only neighborhood where LGBT Chicagoans Live.
"We know that our community is spread out aLL over Chicago," GaLLoway said.
WhiLe Montrose Rocks is a welL-known HIVtesting venue, entertainment is a major draw as weLL. Since organizers are stiLL planning, GaLLoway couLdn't reveaL any anticipated acts. However, neo-soul artist Kenchris and a compLete drag show have been among past attractions.
"We're planning a spectacuLar event," GaLLoway said. "We'LL puLLing peopLe from [aLL over] the community."
Montrose Rocks wiLL also feature U.S. Rep. Danny K. Davis. So, music - and messages - wiLL be prominent. That suits event co-founder and Rocks Coordinating Committee president emeritus MichaeL O'Connor just fine.
"We wanted more than a party," O'Connor said about the efforts of him, Marc Loveless and Lloyd KeLLy to Launch the Montrose Rocks event, several years after the original Belmont Rocks celebration had started.
"Ifs the Largest [organized] African-American presence on the Lakefront," he said.
It became the first group with a Legal right to gather.
"We decided we were going to be proactive," O'Connor said. "We had a Legal right to get the permit and we used that permit."
That permit alLowed Montrose Rocks to showcase entertainment, a vital heaLth service, a platform to policymakers as weLL as LGBT constituent access to those power players.
In addition to Davis, U.S. Reps. Bobby Rush and Jesse Jackson Jr. as weLL as Late former Cook County Board President John Stroger, Jr. and state Rep. Constance Howard have headlined the event. O'Connor is a former staffer for Howard.
Montrose Rocks, he said, honors the AfricanAmerican lawmakers, advocates such as The Civil Rights Agenda's Rick Garda and the unsung heroes who were at New York's StonewaLL Inn -birthpLace of the modern LGBT civiL-rights movement.
"We've honored anyone who's successfuLLy achieved what we consider community service," O'Connor said.
O'Connor said the Rocks Coordinating Committee is the onLy active organization to honor African-American policymakers as weLL as allies publicLy. He stressed why he and feLLow Rocks Coordinating Committee founders had such a civic-minded focus.
"We understood the importance - un Like the apolitical [individuáis] who fought us - of visibility of public policy decision-makers," he said. "That visibility translates into helping public policy."
Before the Rocks Coordinating Committee was created in 1996, house music producer Frankie Knuckles played out of the back of his van at BeLmont Rocks.
"As far as I can remember, African Americans have aLways gathered separateLy from the parade," O'Connor said. "There was a time we were not effectively reached out to."
Frankly, he said, BeLmont Rocks was a direct response to the "inability of promoters to adequately and LegaLLy have a party on the Lakefront." O'Connor said "the Chicago Police ran us off the lakefront" in the 1980s.
"They said we were not a part of the pride events," he said.
Now, thanks to Montrose Rocks, both women and peopLe of coLor have become more involved in pride events. Early in the morning, O'Connor said, the event is more family-oriented. By afternoon, younger gay men make their grand entrance after the parade.
"We make sure there's a public awareness about HIV/AIDS, because [some] organizations clearLy weren't doing their job," O'Connor said. "We have service providers who normaLLy do this work."
Montrose Rocks had ended festivities at 7 p.m. - until violence prompted city pushback. Violence Led to Chicago PoLice Department's demand for a 5 p.m. closure, according to a previous Windy City Times story.
Rocks Coordinating Committee president Ariq Cabbler didn't dispute the vioLence claim. However, Cabbler stressed the effects of an earLier closing time.
"The 3 o'cLock-to-6 o'clock window is critical," Cabbler told Windy City Times, referring to the most popular HIV-testing hours. "If we have to close at 5, that means we have to shut down by 4:30," he added. "The peopLe attending this event wiLL bear the brunt of it."
The city and organizers disagree that the event was being closed early. Then-City of Chicago LGBT liaison BilL Greaves said the city only asked that the pubLic address system be shut off at 5 p.m. IronicaLLy, the PA system is Montrose Rocks' biggest draw - and problem, according to Greaves.
"We're not saying that ifs these peopLe who come here that are causing the vioLence," he said. "Ifs not even the people who come here after the parade. Ifs another element that is drawn here after 5 o'clock [by the entertainment] that is causing the problem."
GaLLoway said the Rocks Coordinating Committee has been working with Chicago PoLice Department District 19, Chicago Park District and 46th Aid. James CappLeman's office to resoLve the closing time issue. He said they were close to a "tentative" compromise on a 7 p.m. closing time.
Tressa Feher, CappLeman's chief of staff, said things are on the right track.
"Everything is moving forward with the event," Feher said. "It wiLL stay the same."

Abstract: One of the things that I think that happens a Lot i n sexuaL violence movements is that men are directly reLated to their penises," [RandaLL Jenson] said. "Therefore, we rape. We penetrate. One of the things that I've aLways struggLed with on a personal LeveLis that being someone who is a bottom; my relationship with my penis is secondary. But in many discussions about sexuaL violence, I 'should' be thinking with my penis.

Full text: Warning: This article contains graphic information about a nonconsensual sexual encounter.
Community activists, university officials, students, and LGBTQ advocates all gathered at DePauL's Munrae HaLL ApriL 25 for "Asking For It" - a pa ne L discussion that focused on the so da L stigmas of sexuaL and domestic violence in gay ma Le communities.
Moderated by RandaLL Jenson, executive director of SociaLScope Productions and founder of 50 Faggots, the paneL included Lara Brooks, director of the Broadway Youth Center; Inc.; John Garver, anti-violence therapist and training deLivery manager at Center on Halsted; Jeff Levy, co-founder and CEO of Live Oak; and Sebastian Torres, coordinator of the office of LGBTQA student services at DePauL University.
Jenson streamed dips from his 50 Faggots film, a documentary that foLLows and showcases effeminate gay men in their queer, prafessionaL and personal Lives. The 50 Faggots clips provided a visual and tangible complement for the overall panel discussion for guest Zachary Stafford.
"I think having visuaL tools in discussions as hard and complicated as sexuaL assault is reaLLy important. It aLLows for assault to take a tangibLe form, and no Longer be abstract," said Stafford.
In particular, other topics addressed and explored by the paneL and audience were the stigma and shame sometimes associated with victims of sexuaL and domestic vioLence in gay ma Le communities, and as those factors relate to sexuaL roLes and attached gender norms. Jenson talked about how his preferred sexuaL role as a bottom is sometimes associated with femininity - making him a potentiaL target for domestic and sexuaL abuse, he said.
"One of the things that I think that happens a Lot i n sexuaL violence movements is that men are directly reLated to their penises," Jenson said. "Therefore, we rape. We penetrate. One of the things that I've aLways struggLed with on a personal LeveLis that being someone who is a bottom; my relationship with my penis is secondary. But in many discussions about sexuaL violence, I 'should' be thinking with my penis. I 'should' be operating in terms of wanting to penetrate something. So, I feel Like I'm aLways sort of at risk of being at vioLence."
Torres plugged into Jenson's correlation of sexuaL roLes and violence in gay male communities. Torres reaffirmed that it could be argued that gay males who identify as a bottom and/or effeminate could be more susceptible to domestic and sexuaL violence.
One of the dips from the 50 Faggots documentary incLuded an interview with a young man named Aaron. During the interview, Aaron shared with viewers his experiences of moving around a Lot with his mother and how she would take in foster children. Aaron recounts witnessing (at the age of 3) his older brothers, teenagers at the time, engaging in a sexuaL "gang bang" with one of his foster sisters, who was around 10.
Aaron also remembers one of his brothers pushing him down whiLe Aaron was trying to get his doLL - whiLe his other brothers were stiLL in the act. After pushing him down the stairs, his older brother waLked in front of Aaron and removed the condom from his penis, according to Aaron. Panel discussion guest John Carver found the image of Aaron going to retrieve his doLL whiLe his older brothers engage in such a sexuaL act especiaLLy intriguing.
"I find it interesting of how he merits the story of what was going on - not just that what couLd be conceived of as a gang bang going on but that he was on his way up to his room to get his do LL and then his brother came down and puLLed off a condom off his erect penis," said Garver. "There are so many messages in that one dip: this whoLe idea of witness and then his experience of survivorship and then the Levels of direct contact. There's no question in my mind that he is a survivor."
Brooks provided another perspective of the clip and revealed to guests her need and want for Aaron to express what he witnessed under what rea LLy happened.
Tm definitely having a hard time with the past dip in a different way in regards to common language," Brooks said. "I just wanted Aaron to say the word 'rape.' I kept watching it and watching it and watching it, and I needed him to say it. I couldn't believe he was taLking about it and not saying it in a way that I needed him to say it - it was rape."
Attendee Ryan Conrad shared with guests his personaL experience of domestic vioLence when he was thrown into a waLL while breaking up with his ex. Conrad said that he actually used humor to deal with the situation afterwards, referring to himseLf as just another domestic vioLence statistic.
"In the end I think this kind of event is reaLLy important because it's about building Larger networks of people who rea LLy engage in these kind of questions and topics that I didn't necessarily have when I experienced my moment of domestic vioLence when I was breaking up with my partner. I had to deal with a Lot of it on my own," said Conrad.
Jenson urged guests to openly discuss the issues of consent, accountability and problematic so da L stigmas of vioLence in gay maLe communities with others.

Abstract: The [Kay Bailey Hutchison] -Grass Ley substitute form of VAWA removed the terms "sexuaL orientation" and "gender identity" from throughout the originaL VAWA reauthorization biLL. Hutchison argued that the substitute stiLL protected samesex coupLes by " neutra Lizi n g" Language referring to victims. She referred to "men who have been gang raped" as an example of such violence.

Full text: A casual Listener to U.S. Senate debate April 26 would not have heard the skirmish over protections for LGBT victims of domestic abuse. Despite reports that Republicans were upset over new Language in the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) that would protect LGBT people. Republicans never said so on the floor of the Senate.
However, Republicans Led an effort to replace the original VAWA reauthorization biLL with a substitute biLL that would have eliminated aLL protections for LGBT victims of domestic abuse.
That Republican substitute biLL was defeated ApriL 26 by a vote of 63-37.
The Senate then went on to approve the original VAWA reauthorization biLL 68-31.
The votes seemed to usher in a new era of Democratic support for incLuding protections and benefits for LGBT in Legislation, as weLL as a quieter yet more menacing tactic by RepubLicans to stop such protections by pitting them against children.
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who introduced and co-authored the substitute biLL with Sen. CharLes GrassLey, R-Iowa, couched the RepubLican substitute as one that kept the "most important" parts of the originaL Legislation whiLe strengthening protections for chiLdren against sexuaL predators.
The Hutchison -Grass Ley substitute form of VAWA removed the terms "sexuaL orientation" and "gender identity" from throughout the originaL VAWA reauthorization biLL. Hutchison argued that the substitute stiLL protected samesex coupLes by " neutra Lizi n g" Language referring to victims. She referred to "men who have been gang raped" as an example of such violence.
The originaL version of this year's VAWA reauthorization biLL, approved onLy by Democrats on the Judiciary Committee and passed by the Senate ApriL 26, includes Language specifying that VAWA-funded programs not discriminate based on the sexuaL orientation or gender identity of a victim.
It also incLudes funding for "underserved" populations "who face barriers in accessing and using victim services because of geographic Location, reLigion, sexuaL orientation, gender identity, underserved raciaL and ethnic populations, populations underserved because of speda L needs (such as Language barriers, disabilities, alienage status, or age), and any other population determined to be underserved by the attorney generaL or by the Secretary of HeaLth and Human Services, as appropriate."
And it provides that certain grants under the Omnibus Crime ControL and Safe Streets Act can be used for "developing, enlarging, or strengthening programs and projects to provide services and responses targeting ma Le and femaLe victims of domestic vioLence, dating vioLence, sexuaL assauLt, or staLking, whose abiLity to access traditionaL services and responses is affected by their sexuaL orientation or gender identity."
The Hutchison -Grass Ley substitute biLL's provision concerning no n -discrimination included aLL categories of the originaL biLL except for sexuaL orientation and gender identity. It defined "underserved populations" the same as the originaL biLL except that it eLiminated those who face barriers due to reLigion, sexuaL orientation, and gender identity. And it gutted a section concerning grants by deleting Language concerning "maLe and femaLe victims. ..whose abiLity to access traditionaL services and responses is affected by their sexuaL orientation or gender identity."
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, criticized the RepubLican substitute as undermining the "core principLes" of the originaL biLL. He said it "strips out key provisions to protect aLL victims ... incLuding victims in same-sex relationships."
Leahy was one of on Ly a few Democratic senators to taLk about specifìcaLLy about LGBT victims of domestic vioLence. Many others - incLuding those with large LGBT constituencies - did not.
Sen. CharLes Schumer, D-N.Y., complained about the Republican substitute biLL for taking out the word "women" and using the word "victim." Doing so, he noted, amounts to aboLishing VAWA and starting a who Le new program.
"No one here would argue that aLL vioLent crimes, aLL domestic crimes are tragic and serious, but this so-caLLed substitute negates centuries of women's experience that proves that vioLence against women - especiaLLy from spouses, partners and famiLy members - is a uniqueLy pernicious and entrenched practice."
Sen. Amy KLobuchar, D-Minn., mentioned "sexuaL orientation" but only in the context of noting that aLL peopLe can be victims of hightech stalking, such as p Lacing hidden cameras in hoteL rooms.
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid described two roadblocks to reauthorization of the VAWA as "non-discrimination protection for aLL victims, regardLess of what they Look Like or where they're from."
And Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-CaLif., criticized RepubLicans for wanting to "excLude peopLe" from protection, but her three exampLes of victims did not include an LGBT person.
But Sen. Richard B Lu ment h a L, D-Conn., did speak out strongly in support of Language incLuding LGBT victims of domestic abuse.
"CLearLy, there's a reaL need to improve access and availabiLity of services for this vuLnerabLe population," said BLumenthaL Thursday, "and I support measures in this act that ensure victims of domestic and sexuaL vioLence, regardLess of their sexuaL orientation or gender identity, can access those services they need."
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he doesn't beLieve any of the "points of controversy" on the biLL were important enough to vote against reauthorization of the Law. He specifícaLLy mentioned protection should be availabLe to aLL victims "regardLess of gender."
VAWA (S. 1925) has been a popular piece of Legislation since 1994, when it was first passed. But this year, it has become a battLeground for the votes of women in the 2012 presidentiaL campaign and a battLe over protections for LGBT peopLe, Native Americans, and immigrant women without documentation to be in this country.
Rita Smith, executive director of the NationaL CoaLition Against Domestic VioLence, said the coaLition "cannot support any biLL that does not include language to protect vulnerable and under resources populations of victims of domestic violence, sexuaL assault and stalking."
"It is imperative that Native women, immigrant women, and the LGBTQ communities aLL have access to resources and support and S. 1925 incLudes criticaL services for these populations. No other biLL or amendment addresses these necessary changes to provide services for aLL victims."
Democrats see the biLL as a means of increasing protections for victims of domestic abuse; RepubLicans see it as an excuse to funneL federal funds to progressive groups, such as LGBT health clinics. They also claim the new provisions this year were added to make it hard for RepubLicans to support. GrassLey said the tactic was pure politics and meant to deflect attention away from "health care reform, unemployment or high gas prices."
A study by the NationaL CoaLition indicated that, in 2010, programs serving LGBT peopLe who were abused by their domestic partners or other intimate partners recorded 5,052 reports of such abuse. ALmost 45 percent of these victims reported being turned away by other groups heLping domestic vioLence victims.
The national coaLition includes a large number of groups working to prevent domestic vioLence and heLp its victims, incLuding the Community United Against VioLence (San Francisco), the Center on Halsted (Chicago), the Resource Center DaLlas, the Braward (FLa.) LGBT Domestic VioLence CoaLition, the San Diego LGBT Center, the L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center, the Fenway Community HeaLth VioLence Recovery Program (Boston), Wingspan (Arizona), United4Safety (Atlanta) and GLOV(D-C.).
Human Rights Campaign official David Stacy said the Hutchison -Grass Ley substitute was "not a serious attempt" to find a resolution and would jeopardize important funding to groups that do serve LGBT victims.
Supporters of VAWA had 61 senators going into the debate this week, incLuding both senators from ILLinois, CaLifornia and Massachusetts, as weLL as BiLL Nelson of Florida, Carl Levin of Michigan and Bob Casey of PennsyLvania. Neither of Texas' RepubLican senators co-sponsored the Legislation.
A spokeswoman for RepubLican presidential nominee-apparent Mitt Romney said last week that Romney supports the biLL but did not clarify whether he objects to the new language prohibiting discrimination based on sexuaL orientation or gender identity.
The VAWA in the House (HR 4271) has 52 cosponsors, including open Ly gay Reps. Barney Frank, D-Mass., and. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., but not openly gay Reps. Jared PoLis, D-CoLo., and David Cicaline, D-R. I. Debate in the House is also expected to be contentious, with House Majority Leader Eric Cantor reportedly pushing for a RepubLican version of the reauthorization measure there.
R. Clarke Cooper, executive director of Log Cabin RepubLicans, issued a statement, saying, "Nobody should be able to get away with domestic abuse just because their victim is gay, transgender, an immigrant or Native American, and nobody should be denied help in recovering from abuse. Standing in the way of passing this Legislation is unconscionable. Log Cabin RepubLicans are proud of our aLLies in the Senate who have cosponsored this biLL, incLuding Mike Crapo, RIdaho, who introduced the biLL, and Sens. Ayotte, R-N. H.; Brown, R-Mass.; CoLLins, R-Maine; HeLLer, R-Nev.; Kirk, R-ILL., Murkowski, R-Alaska; and Snowe, R-Maine. Passage of S. 1925 should move forward swiftly, and any effort to water down the VioLence Against Women Act should be roundLy condemned."

Full text: Headnote ELECTIONS' 12:
In October 2010- just eight months after Losing a Democratic primary in the same district - Mary Trew was appointed judge of the 9th Subcircuit by the Illinois Supreme Court.
"Ive been trying to do this [become a judge] for 13 years and, all of a sudden, it just popped," Trew said at the time.
The Longtime Lawyer and out Lesbian has since presided over an area that incLudes Evanston, NiLes, Skokie, LincoLnwood and Rogers Park. On March 20, Trew wiLL face three chaLLengers in a primary race to hold onto her seat for another six years.
Windy City Times caught up with Trew to discuss her new career, busy civiL union scheduLe and prospects for 2012.
Windy City Times: Can you tell us how you got started in law?
Mary Trew: My entire background has been in pub Lie interest Law. I started out as a pub Lie defender in Detroit. [When I moved to] Chicago, I worked for an agency caLLed the Domestic Violence LegaL CLinic, where I uLtimateLy became executive director. That agency provides services for victims of domestic vioLence, as weLL as other family Law services Like orders of protection, divorces, and custody help.
In my role as executive director, we started one of the nation's first on-site court cLinics in the domestic vioLence courthouse. My whoLe career has been about providing services to poor peopLe. I didn't enter Law to make money, because I never did. [Laughs] My reason was to increase access to Legal services and a [Leviate the injustices in the world. There's a Lot of [injustice] stiLL, but I see a LittLe bit of a difference.
Ifs been a 30-year career; I hate to say it. [Laughs] Time fties.
WCT: And did you work at the Domestic VioLence LegaL CLinic right up until you were appointed judge?
MT: Yes. When I first got appointed, I was in traffic court Like everyone else. After about three months, I got promoted to the domestic relations division. I'm in custody and parentage court, which is a speciaLized court deaLing with children and peopLe who aren't married to each other, essentially. Ifs a pretty good match for my background.
WCT: You've said in earlier interviews that you wanted to be a judge even more than a lawyer. Does that still stand up?
MT: Oh, absoLutely. One of the things I had feared when I first became a judge was: What if I don't Like this after aLL this time? [Laughs] It is a LittLe scary at first, when you first take the bench. Everybody's Looking at you, and you're in charge. But I was Like a duck to water. My sense that this was something I wanted to do and would be good at is bearing out. I just Love it.
WCT: Any exciting moments so far?
MT: I performed a Lot of the civil unions when [the CiviL Unions Act] first went into Law Last year. I've probably done about 60 or 70 of them. It's really a nice feeLing to be abLe to do that. As a judge, I do so many things that make peopLe mad or make one person mad. So it's reaLLy nice to do something that makes peopLe happy.
And my partner and I got civi L- unionized, or whatever you want to caLL it, in December. We've been together 15 years.
WCT: Do you think there are any areas of the law where LGBT people are particularly discriminated against?
MT: Whaf s a LittLe bit difficuLt is aLL the hodgepodge of state-to-state Laws. It's pretty exciting for someone of my generation - I'm 56 - to see aLL the change that's come in the Last 5-10 years, which I regard as being kind of generational·. I think young peopLe are causing it to happen. There's a reaL divide for gay peopLe between generations.
What's a LittLe bit difficuLt is that bans on discrimination don't come from the top-down. In other words, it's going from state-to-state. So that does make it chaLLenging. It's not just the marriage Laws; its aLL the civil area Laws.... the right to traveL, the right to reLocate. One state's Laws might be very discriminatory, and another's not so much. Other minority groups have had that [protection] at a federal Level. I think ultimateLy that will happen for us; it just takes time.
I've seen a change in how courts and judges react to LGBT peopLe; it's gotten much, much better... at Least in [Cook] County.
WCT: How so?
MT: Just an attitude, reaLLy. Ifs compLetely different. When I was much younger, there was a great deaL of ridicule in the court system for anybody who was gay or perceived to be. It's changed remarkably in the Last few years. And I'm not saying the discrimination isn't' still there. Of course it is. But it's not so institutionalized.
WCT: There are four candidates in your primary. What sets you apart from the rest?
MT: We're aLL good peopLe. What makes me a LittLe different is that I was appointed by the Supreme Court. I've been endorsed by organizations - not politicians or anything to do with politics. I was endorsed by the Chicago tribune; and I was found qualified, recommended, or highly recommended by all of the evaluating Law firms.
I was endorsed, appointed and vetted by peopLe in the know. You hear repeatedLy from voters that they don't know who the judicial candidates are. WeLL, the Supreme Court knows who they want to put as judge. The Tribune, the bar associations - I've been through a reaLLy Lengthy and excruciating vetting process by aLL those entities. Those peopLe have given me a "thumbs up," so I'm hoping the voters wiLL, too.

Full text: When Ron Okerson met his former partner, he thought it was Love. The pair hit it off and quickly became involved, eventually cohabitating.
"He was wonderful, charming," said Okerson.
However, after the honeymoon stage, the relationship quickly spiraled into a pattern of physical, mental, psychological and sexual abuse.
'It turned out that he really wasn't [wonderful], and by the time I realized it, I was already sucked in and the abuse had already started," said Okerson. "He abused me in many unimaginable ways, ranging from beating my head while I slept to holding a carving knife to my throat threatening to cut my head off starting from the back so he could hear me scream."
Out of work and alienated from friends and family, Okerson did not have anywhere else to go. After two years of Living with his partner, a neighbor who frequently overheard the abuse eventually persuaded Okerson to Leave his partner by offering him a place to stay.
'The day I Left, he beat me with a broomstick," said Okerson. "That's the type of guy he is."
LGBT-specific sheLters and abuse-survivor services are rare, especiaLLy for men. Few federaL and state surveys enumerate sexual orientation, making it difficult to show social service agencies that domestic vioLence is an issue for the LGBT community; however, a Center for American Progress survey estimates 30 percent of same-sex partnerships experience domestic vioLence.
"Most people think of domestic vioLence as something between a man and a woman, and are just unaware of the fact that same-sex couples sometimes have problems and difficuLties and challenges. Some of those include violence between the partners, unfortunately," said Jeff KreheLy, vice president of LGBT research and communications at the Center for American Progress.
Okerson caLLed on sociaL service agencies for the homeless to secure temporary housing, finding it difficuLt for an unmarried, able-bodied gay man without dependents to access services. But he eventuaLLy Landed in the ILLinois Department of Human Services (DHS) Independent Living program at the Lakeview YMCA.
But even away from his home, Okerson couLd not escape the abuse.
"My ex showed up at the [YMCA] and yeLLed at me, ? should have kiLLed you,'" said Okerson.
Upon signing the housing agreement, Okerson's DHS case manager asked him about his job pLans. To earn a higher wage, Okerson wanted to compLete a certificate for medicaL billing and coding, but he would need money for tuition, so he sought out employment. As a homeless person, he struggled to find a job because he had no money for bus fare. Let a Lone the basics for an interview Like cLean Laundry or a haircut.
Okerson diligentLy researched every avenue he could think of for assistance, bringing his notes and documentation to every meeting with a social service agency. Through his seLf-advocacy, he often found that he knew more about available services than his case managers, one of whom "asked me to put my notes away because she was intimidated by them."
""I understand that while case managers may be overworked there are processes that can and should be implemented to streamline many things," said Okerson.
Navigating social services and bureaucracy proved so overwhelming and exhausting for Okerson that he started wishing he had never Left his abusive partner.
"I was so beaten down by the system that I thought maybe Leaving my ex was a mistake," said Okerson. "I was starting to beLieve I had Left him for nothing."
Desperate, Okerson turned to selling his bLood and plasma for cash, but before he could donate he was tested for HIV.
"My HIV diagnosis was devastating - absoluteLy devastating," said Okerson. "But I was told a Lot of doors would be opening for me [to access HIV sodai services], and it was even more devastating when they didn't."
In need of counseling and HIV-reLated medicai care, Okerson turned to Howard Brown Health Center, a place that Okerson said "absoluteLy saved my Life."
The DHS Independent Living program only offers temporary housing, and the end of his stay at the YMCA was growing near. JobLess, penmless and soon-to-be homeLess, Okerson was granted a one-time, one-month extension of services, buying him some time to secure aLternate accommodations.
Having exhausted every avenue he could find for help - sociaL service agencies, elected officials, government agencies and LocaL charities - Okerson sent a desperate pLea to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). John Trasvina, assistant secretary for HUD's Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity program, shared Okerson's story with Chicago HUD office, who reached out to Okerson and referred him to a housing program.
"Domestic vioLence in the LGBT community is an area where we're just Lacking a Lot of knowledge, a Lot of services. We're hoping that can change," said KreheLy.
While still struggling to access basic needs, Okerson has Lined up housing for when his stay at the YMCA ends. He also Landed a work-study position, for which he will receive a smaLL stipend.
"ALL I am asking for is the opportunity to reclaim and rebuild my Life," said Okerson. "It shouldn't be this hard."
Those dealing with domestic partner/intimate partner vioLence can caLL the Anti-Violence Crisis HotLine at the Center on HaLsted at 773-871CARE or the nationaL Stop Abuse For Everyone hotline at 616-941-0825.

Full text: Supporters of Lesbian Judge Mary S. Trew hosted a campaign fundraiser March 4 at Tsamis Law Firm in AndersonviLLe.
After two unsuccessfuL - but close- judicial campaigns, the ILLinois Supreme Court appointed Trew to the Epstein vacancy in the 9th JudidaL Subcircuit in November 2010.
"I'd get close. I had good bar ratings. You get close enough, you feel Like you can taste it," said Trew.
Once appointed, Trew was assigned to parentage court because of her background in family Law, hearing mainly custody, visitation and child support cases.
"The court is high-volume. There's Lots of probLems, Lots families in crisis, lots of domestic violence," said Trew.
Trew also performs dvil unions, and Led a mass civil-union ceremony organized by the Civil Rights Agenda in June 2011 in MiLLennium Park.
She is currentLy running to retain her seat in the Democratic primary March 20.
"I hope peopLe consider my candidacy. My whole career, the reason I do what I do, is to serve the public," said Trew.

Abstract: [Brad Trowbridge]: I started counseLing in 1986, after I got my master's degree. Then I went to Northwestern University to be their "gay counselor," so to speak. There'd been at Least one suicide on campus by a gay student, and there was a second student that they suspected of being gay. The administration thought we needed to address this head-on, so they sent a message to the LGBT student population that they valued LGBT students and had a resource avaiLabLe to them.

Full text: Since leaving his counseLing position at Northwestern University more than a decade ago, Brad Trowbridge has Launched his own famiLyLaw practice, represented more than 500 domestic abuse victims and written a chapter on civiL unions for the ILLinois Bar Association.
This month, the openLy gay attorney is Looking to make the next leap in his career as a candidate in the 8th JudiciaL Subcircuit. Trowbridge recently sat down with the Windy City Times to taLk about his campaign, counseLing work and hopes for 2012.
Windy City Times: Can you tell us a little bit about your counseling background?
Brad Trowbridge: I started counseLing in 1986, after I got my master's degree. Then I went to Northwestern University to be their "gay counselor," so to speak. There'd been at Least one suicide on campus by a gay student, and there was a second student that they suspected of being gay. The administration thought we needed to address this head-on, so they sent a message to the LGBT student population that they valued LGBT students and had a resource avaiLabLe to them. Although I counseled aLL undergraduate and graduate students, I was the designated gay counselor. I dealt with a Lot of coming out issues.
WCT: What prompted your transition into law?
BT: I derided I wanted to be more of an advocate. I went to Law school at the University of ILLinois at Urbana-Champaign, and couLdn't move back here fast enough. [Laughs] It's hard to be in your 30s and out in Champaign.
As a counseLor and therapist, your role is to help peopLe heaL from traumatic experiences. Many of the students I worked with at Northwestern had suffered some sort of abuse in their Lives, some sort of childhood trauma. Many of them were having a hard time coming out, either because of their family, their church or society in generaL. We're taLking about the earLy-to mid-'90s. The notion of civiL unions or same-sex marriage was not even seriously considered.
I derided that it rea LLy wasn't my natural way to be - to be the comforter and the healer, the therapist. I reaLly wanted to roLL up my sLeeves and go kick butt, go do something. Law school wouLd give me an avenue to do that.
WCT: Your campaign slogan is "All Families Matter." Can you tell us more about that?
BT: It's supposed to encompass the idea that aLL families are important. A family couLd be one person. It could be a straight couple, a samesex coupLe, a coupLe that has children, a single mother or a victim of abuse.
Ifs everybody. One of the things that I've Learned in my career is that our court system doesn't often demonstrate that aLL families do matter. Sometimes peopLe who have the money and resources get better treatment, better representation - or representation at aLL Many peopLe can't afford representation. I want to send the message that aLL peopLe should be treated equaLLy, have equaL access to the courts and get the same justice.
WCT: I saw that you ran in the 2010 judicial election, but withdrew.
BT: We thought there was going to be an opening in the 8th Subcircuit. My intention at the time was to get a head start if that opening ever became avaiLabLe, and it didn't. An opening occurred countywide, and I tried to get enough signatures at the Last minute to get on the balLot. When it became clear that I didn't have enough, I withdrew.
WCT: You wrote a chapter on same-sex relationships in the Illinois State Bar Association's Family Law Handbook. How did that come about?
BT: I don't know. [Laughs] I got a caLl from the editor. Someone had referred me because they knew I worked with a Lot of same-sex couples; I think it was just word of mouth in SpringfieLd.
They asked me to write about civiL unions and same-sex couples - not so much as an advocate, but as an educator. It was finished in December 2010, but we heLd off publishing since the Civil Unions Act was about to be voted on. Once that was passed, [the chapter] changed entireLy. It was reaLly focusing on how same-sex coupLes co u Ld contract with themselves to share property and raise children - to sort of Lega LLy meLd their Lives together. With the passage of the civiL union act, that made things a Little easier - kind of Like one-stop shopping.
WCT: Do you think there are any areas of the law where LGBT people are particularly discriminated against?
BT: The Law, for the most part, is gender- and sexual orientation-neutraL. What reaLly comes into pLay is the judge that peopLe end up standing in front of.
One of the things I think wiLL be interesting: We ceLebrated the passage of the Civil Unions Act this past June. WeLL, if our reLationships are Like heterosexual reLationships, half of those essentially 'marriages' are going to end. We're going to end up in the court system more than ever before.
It'LL be interesting to see how our judges handle same-sex coupLes essentiaLLy divorcing and disputing custody of their children. That could be an area where we're at a disadvantage. We don't know whether those judges are going to treat us with respect.... or whether gender stereotypes are going to come into pLay in terms of awarding custody.
We need judges who have more than just sound Legal minds. We have to have judges who understand the compLexities of Life today: human reLationships, same-sex marriage, same-sex coupLes having children, domestic violence. It's a different worLd than it was 20 years ago.

LGBT intimate violence report released

Author: Davis, Andrew

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/lgbt-intimate-violence-report-released/docview/912813893/se-2?accountid=14696

Abstract: Also, the report revealed that more survivors were turned away from shelters than in 2009. "Very few shelters in the greater Chicago metropolitan area take male survivors of IPV or domestic violence," he said. "And an equally small number take transgender survivors, so their options are [greatly] reduced."

Full text: The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) released its report, "Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Intimate Partner Violence in the United States in 2010," according to a press release.
Among the report's findings is that there were six intimate partner violence (IPV)-related murders - the same number as the previous year. Of the victims, four identified as female.
In 2010, NCAVP programs received 5,052 reports of IPV, an increase of 38.1 percent from 2009. The L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center (LAGLC) received additional funding for their IPV programming, accounting for a significant portion of the increase in reported numbers nationwide. "In 2010 we were able to hire a dedicated staff person to focus on gathering information about local IPV incidents," said Susan Holt, Program Manager, STOP Partner Abuse/Domestic Violence Program at the L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center.
Possibly the most stunning result is that fewer survivors called the police. In 2010, 7.1 percent of survivors called authorities for support - a 14-percent decrease from the previous year.
Chicago's Center on Halsted was one of the organizations involved in this report. Edwin Corbin-Gutierrez - who was with the Center on Halsted's Anti-Violence Project at the time of this interview - told Windy City Times that IPV "refers to abuse or domestic violence happening between two partners. [However,] when we think of domestic violence, we think of husbands and wives, or boyfriends and girlfriends. But it can happen to same-sex couples, and people don't have to be living together."
He added the physical abuse is only one component: "There is emotional and psychological abuse, and there may be tactics, including tactics and using homophobia and transphobia to exert power and control. Threatening to out a parent to get custody of children is just one example."
As for the marked decrease in survivors contacting police, Corbin-Gutierrez said that the numbers might be deceptive, as the 16 centers around the country who put the report together got 5,000 more calls last year. "We might want to look at [certain] reports, but it's also important to note that sometimes the person who calls gets arrested as well," he said. "The police may not be able to tell who the abuser is, or no one is arrested." (The report cited historical distrust of the police as one factor for the decrease.)
Also, the report revealed that more survivors were turned away from shelters than in 2009. "Very few shelters in the greater Chicago metropolitan area take male survivors of IPV or domestic violence," he said. "And an equally small number take transgender survivors, so their options are [greatly] reduced."
Corbin-Gutierrez said that he was surprised by the increase in calls to the centers. "I think that speaks to reaching out to a wider audience. It tells me that the need is out there," he said.
NCAVP received a $25,000 grant from Verizon Wireless to increase access and support for LGBTQ and HIV-affected victims and survivors of domestic and sexual violence.
The report is available at http://www.avp. org/ncavp.htm.

Abstract: [Mara Keisling] added, "So many kinds of violence are epidemic for transgender people: hate violence, domestic violence, sexual violence, school bullying, and violence by police. And though certain categories of trans people are more likely to face violence, especially people of color, working class people, young people, women and immigrants, all demographic categories of trans people are more likely to be victims than non-trans people."

Full text:   lGBT anti-violence advocates met with Obama Administration officials Nov. 16 to offer strategies for addressing the epidemic of violence against transgender people, according to a press release from the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE).
The administration heard a broad range of policy ideas from a total of nine organizations.
NCTE Executive Director Mara Keisling facilitated the meeting, and the team included, among others, Gwendolyn Smith, the founder of the Transgender Day of Remembrance. Smith shared with the administration real-life stories of transgender people who have faced violence.
Keisling said, "Meeting with the White House at all, especially the week prior to Transgender Day of Remembrance, says a lot about the president's commitment to making America safer and better for transgender people."
Topics covered included crime-data collection; cultural competency for law enforcement; and funding issues, including insuring that federal and federally funded anti-violence programs and processes are transgender-inclusive. Violence against youth, homeless trans people and trans women were key issues.
Keisling added, "So many kinds of violence are epidemic for transgender people: hate violence, domestic violence, sexual violence, school bullying, and violence by police. And though certain categories of trans people are more likely to face violence, especially people of color, working class people, young people, women and immigrants, all demographic categories of trans people are more likely to be victims than non-trans people."

Abstract: "[We need] to move the runaway issue from where it is to where domestic violence is right now, where it's in the spotLight and it's a huge priority," Clair said. "If an infant it taken from their home, there's an Amber Alert. If a 14-yearold runs away, they're a missing person for 24 hours. There's a disconnect."

Full text: Ad u Lts who ran away from home as children are significantly more Likely to experience substance abuse, suicidal thoughts and economic hardship than their peers, according to a new study from the National Runaway Switchboard (NRS).
Key researcher Jennifer Benoit-Bryan presented the "Runaway Youth Longitudinal Study 2011" Nov. 1 at an NRS-sponsored Luncheon and panel discussion.
"We hope that identifying the Long-term consequences of running away wiLL encourage parents, teachers and other adults to get invoLved earLier to prevent a runaway situation," NRS Executive Director Maureen BLaha said.
The first of its kind to use nationaLLy representative data, the study interviewed 15,000 peopLe at four points spanning 15 years to trace Long-term impacts of running away from home. The disparities were startling.
Ad u Lts who had run away earn on average $8,823 Less per year than their counterparts. And the chances the/LL become recipients of weLfare or other pubLic assistance are 76 percent higher.
"It makes sense," Benoit-Bryan said. "Runaways tend to miss school. They tend to faLL behind their peers. They're Less LikeLy to get these important GEDs and have these higher Levels of education that wiLL affect their income Later in Life."
HeaLth disparities persist through aduLthood. Those who had run away were 2.4 times as LikeLy to smoke cigarettes, 67 percent more LikeLy to smoke marijuana and 53 percent more LikeLy to report having an STD.
Depression is more common, and the LikeLihood of suicidaL thoughts increased by 51 percent. Runaways are also more than three times as LikeLy to commit suicide.
In addition to investigating Long-term effects, Benoit-Bryan tracked which groups were most LikeLy to become runaways. Youth who identify as LGBT top the List. According to the study, 7.6 percent of heterosexuaL youth run away, compared to 21.7 percent of bisexuaL youth and 13 percent of homosexuaL youth.
FoLLowing the presentation, NBC anchor Lauren Jiggetts hosted a paneL discussion featuring Akeshia Craven, NRS board member and CPS officer of Pathways to CoLLege & Career; BiLL Clair, youth services program manager, DHHS, Family Youth Services; and Kathy Ryg, president of Voices for ILLinois Children.
"[We need] to move the runaway issue from where it is to where domestic violence is right now, where it's in the spotLight and it's a huge priority," Clair said. "If an infant it taken from their home, there's an Amber Alert. If a 14-yearold runs away, they're a missing person for 24 hours. There's a disconnect."
Panelists focused on how to use NRS data in poLicymaking, agreeing that funding should be shifted toward preventive measures. Each expressed concern that ILLinois budget cuts wo u Ld slash much-needed youth mental health services, which Ryg said could help avert runaway situations.
"We have to Look at the whole system and make sure that we're not addressing the issue when it's aLready occurred, when it's more expensive," she said.

Mark Ishaug pushes AIDS agenda in Chicago and far beyond

Abstract: Iâeuro(TM)m always looking for the intersection. Iâeuro(TM)m doing a big project with the National Network to End Domestic Violence, helping build curricula for DV providers and AIDS providers. Thatâeuro(TM)s the kind of stuff that really energizes me: looking at where we can intersect our worlds. Because people with AIDS donâeuro(TM)t live in a silo, theyâeuro(TM)re not just people with AIDSâeuro?theyâeuro(TM)re people with everything else.

Full text: Humanitarian Mark Ishaug has been working zealously for social justice surrounding the often-taboo subjects of hunger, homelessness, healthcare, HIV/AIDS and civil rights for more than 30 years. His work in developing the program CARE International-Mozambique in 1990 landed him on the global map, funneling into the underserved population. Later, he would join AIDS Foundation of Chicago (AFC) and ACT UP.
Today, Ishaug serves as the CEO of AIDS United (a merger between the National AIDS Fund and AIDS Action) in Washington, D.C. In addition, Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn appointed the passionate pioneer to be one of the 22 statewide leaders on the new Commission to End Hunger.
Windy City Times: Your work in Africa led you in 1990 to develop CARE InternationalMozambique. How did that career opportunity transpire?
Mark Ishaug: I was actually in grad school at Northwestern University, working on a Ph.D. (which I did not get, I got a masterâeuro(TM)s degree), but I was working. While attending Northwestern, I got a MacArthur Foundation scholarship that took me to Mozambique. And while I was doing research there at the university, I ended up getting, maybe, a six- or eight-month gig with CARE International Mozambique, working in its emergency-relief program. It was really an amazing experience.
WCT: Can you tell us a few things about how you were personally affected by your work in Africa?
MI: My first trip to Africa was in 1983, so almost 30 years ago, and I actually âeuro* Iâeuro(TM)ve known about HIV and AIDS for 30 years, since the first case was reported in 1981. When I went to Africa for the first time, I remember thinking that with how itâeuro(TM)s transmitted and, you know âeuro* it was possibly going to be a hot spot in the world. I actually remember coming back, really, really sick, in 1983, and one of my friends who was with me, her folks were doctors, and they were actually talking about the potential of HIV in Africa back then.
And then I went to Zimbabwe in 1987, and it was really an interesting time in 1987 in Zimbabwe, because there was basically, like, official denial in Zimbabwe and Mozambique that HIV and AIDS was a problem at all. I remember reading articles in the paper and talking to people from Zimbabwe, that said, âeurooeOh, no, this is a Europeanâeuro?this is an American problem, thereâeuro(TM)s never going to be HIV in Africa. This doesnâeuro(TM)t affect âeuro* this wonâeuro(TM)t affect Africans, it will only affect white people.âeuro? I remember being so frustrated because of course knowing by then many people, Black and white, from all over the world, who had become infected with âeuro* and were living with or had died of HIV and AIDS, it was so frustrating to me, back then, 25 years ago, to just âeuro* to watch the complete and utter denial of a disease that has now devastated the continent.
WCT: You joined AIDS Foundation of Chicago (AFC) in 1991 as a policy analyst and worked as policy director. At that time, how was the city of Chicago directly affected by HIV and AIDS?
MI: Oh, horrifically. I was working during grad school [as a waiter at Ann Sather restaurant owned by Tom Tunney, who is now an alderman] in Chicago, so from 1988 to 1991, I remember working there and just meeting hundreds of people that were affected by HIV and AIDS. And we saw in the mid- to-late âeuro(TM)80s just how Chicago was being ravaged by this epidemic. Organizations like Chicago House and Test Positive Aware Network and Howard Brown and the AIDS Foundation, in the mid- to-late âeuro(TM)80s, were trying to do so much for the hundreds, if not thousands, of people that were dying, when there was so little to offer them. I know it sounds like a cli-chÃ©, but when I started doing this work, we were really helping people die with dignity. There was one drug, maybe two, and they were somewhat life-extending, but they were not life-saving in any way. So it was a very âeuro* it was a very dark and depressing time.
On the other hand, it was also a time of great hope and great inspiration because individuals were rallying to save their own lives and to save their friends and their brothers and their sisters and their loved ones. And ACT UP was an unbelievable force for change, and what the folks at ACT UP/Chicago did to raise awareness, to demand government support, to push the private sector, to raise media awareness, to get the American Medical Association (AMA) to change its policies âeuro* just so much exciting stuff that really did change the course of the epidemic.
So that time, 20 years ago, was full of contradictions. Because it was about death and dying, but it was about life and great hope. It was âeuro* âeurooeThe sky is falling, but everythingâeuro(TM)s going to be great.âeuro? It was a difficult time.
I also started at the AIDS Foundation right after the Ryan White Care Act was passed and one of the first things I did, new on the job (I had only been there a week or two), was lobby for the first Ryan White Care Act appropriation in Washington, D.C. So it was a very, very exciting time, in the spring of 1991, to be on the Hill, fighting for what would be that hundreds of millions of dollars for emergency AIDS relief in places like Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, New York, and L.A. And we were successful, our first year out. We went from no appropriations to hundreds of millions of dollars. Desperately needed and not enough. âeuro* So thatâeuro(TM)s how I started my career in HIV, 20 years ago.
And so ironically or coincidentally now, Iâeuro(TM)m in D.C., most of the time, fighting for healthcare reform; and fighting for Ryan White appropriations; and figuring out new and smarter and more efficient ways that we can care for people and to prevent new infections.
WCT: Thatâeuro(TM)s an amazing body of work in 20 years. Do you think that because Ryan White was a straight little boy, that maybe Congress was more willing to listen, instead of it being a gay person that they were speaking to? Do you think there was some discrimination or compassion because he wasnâeuro(TM)t gay?
MI: Well, I mean, Jeanne White and Ryan White really changed the course of this epidemic. He was the inspiration for millions of people. I mean, obviously the inspiration for key individuals like Elton John and others. Elton John will even say that he wasnâeuro(TM)t involved in this work until he met Ryan White, and Ryan White changed his outlook on life, and so Ryan and Jeanne have just been an inspiration to millions. And we literally wouldnâeuro(TM)t âeuro* itâeuro(TM)s possible that we wouldnâeuro(TM)t have the [Ryan White] Care Act today, and the billions of dollars that we have for treatment and drugs, if it werenâeuro(TM)t for his inspirational life.
It was really easy thenâeuro?and itâeuro(TM)s still easy now, in some waysâeuro?for people to compartmentalize their compassion and/or their fears. HIV was, and in many ways still is, in many parts of the world and in the United States, a stigmatized disease. So clearly, Ryan White, a boy who was infected through a drug transfusion, as opposed to unsafe sex, unclean needles, or prostitution, or any of the stigmatizing quote-unquote behaviors associated with HIV, drug use, et cetera âeuro* yeah. We were lucky that Ryan Whiteâeuro(TM)s story and his sheer force of personality inspired so many people. Itâeuro(TM)s âeuro* it was just the reality of the times. It says a lot both about the discrimination that so existed in this country 20-plus years ago. It also showed the enormous heart and compassion that people can have for people that are sick and dying. Itâeuro(TM)s truly a double-edged sword.
WCT: Are there any distinct incidences that stand out to you in the past 20 years, that you look back upon and say, âeurooeOkay, I was involved in this series of events and it definitely made an important imprintâeuro? in regards to fighting the epidemic?
MI: A couple of things. You know, clearly on the care and treatment side. You know, this [interview] is not just about me, this is about the AIDS Foundation and the sector, but I think our mobilization around the Ryan White Care Act and our fierce and effective lobbying for the Ryan White Care Act is just a âeuro* itâeuro(TM)s a huge success. I think that the advocacy to get the drug companies to invest in better treatments, to discover better treatments, to make those accessible âeuro* I mean, just a generalized advocacy, I think, of the AIDS movement really has inspired many others, and womenâeuro(TM)s groups, and those suffering from other life-threatening or chronic diseases. So I do think that our voices and organizing of people living with HIV has really changed the landscape in America. So that is, of course, one of my proudest accomplishments.
I think our work around needle exchange and making access to clean needles available in Illinois and many other places is a huge contribution to the fight against AIDS, and a very tough battle that we waged in Illinois for years, almost a decade. You know, when the science was incontrovertible, we still couldnâeuro(TM)t get lawmakers to agree to support something that in fact would save lives and save money and not increase drug use, because of fear, because of stigma, because of âeuro* people were either putting their heads in the sand and not dealing with the fact that clean needles save lives, but just focusing on the stigmatizing behavior of drug use. But that, I think, was a major accomplishment in really turning the tide.
Also, the work of many of my colleagues in Chicago around prenatal transmission, prevention (people like Anne Statton from PACPI and Mardge Cohen and many others) has been one area of advancement in treatment and prevention, where weâeuro(TM)re basically eliminating mother-tochild transmission in America and really have the potential to do it across the world.
And of course being at the advent of just these amazing antiretrovirals and other therapiesâeuro? again, which I had nothing to do withâeuro?but I am just so ecstatic that we have such amazing therapies that are reducing viral load, making the virus almost undetectable.
The other thing that Iâeuro(TM)m really excited about âeuro* again, I played a small role in thisâeuro?itâeuro(TM)s been mostly Jim Pickett at the AIDS Foundation and othersâeuro?but I have played a role in microbicide advocacy, including rectal microbicide advocacy, for many years now. Not as a leader, but as a supporter of Jim Pickett and others that are doing this work. But I think weâeuro(TM)ve really âeuro* weâeuro(TM)re moving the needle on prevention technologies. Itâeuro(TM)s not just the condom; itâeuro(TM)s also the microbicide and itâeuro(TM)s the rectal microbicide, and so on.
For me, the bottom line is that because weâeuro(TM)ve had such success over the last 20 years and there are so many potential successes on the horizon, especially in HIV prevention and the use of biomedical interventions for prevention, that I just have such great hope that we really are going to end this epidemic in America in my lifetime. And thatâeuro(TM)s what keeps me going. Thatâeuro(TM)s what energizes me and thatâeuro(TM)s what gets me out of bed every morning to do this work.
WCT: You are quick to recognize all of your colleagues in this effort to eradicate HIV/ AIDS. Do you feel that support throughout the community as a whole?
MI: It really is about the collective. I mean, what inspires me about doing this work is that I feel like I have thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of colleagues. I might only work with 30 at AIDS United directly, or work with 70 at AIDS Foundation, but I think about the thousands of people that I get to work with every day, through all these different organizations, not just HIV but sort of broader healthcare and advocacy groups.
I think the future to ending this epidemic are all of us who are doing this sort of AIDS-focused work to do it through a much broader coalition, connecting with the domestic violence groups in a much deeper way because of the intersection of HIV and domestic violence, and working closely with all the other disease-specific entities. Folks looking at diabetes, and folks working to fight cancer, and folks working to fight heart disease âeuro* everything that affects our clients today we didnâeuro(TM)t even think about 20 years ago. We were so busy fighting AIDS [back then] and now weâeuro(TM)re helping people live with HIV and a whole host of other chronic medical conditions. So I just think itâeuro(TM)s âeuro* itâeuro(TM)s a really exciting time, and if we could all collectively focus our energy on making sure that healthcare reform is implemented in 2014, and if we all work together on the National HIV/ AIDS Strategy, I really do believe âeuro* again, itâeuro(TM)s clichÃ©: we sent a man to the moon, thereâeuro(TM)s no way we cannot end this epidemic.
WCT: There are an estimated 600,000 people living with HIV that are not receiving the life-saving access to care they need. And Iâeuro(TM)m wondering if youâeuro(TM)re also drawing this correlation that a lot of us seem to be: that now that we have all of these drugs, people are a little bit more lax about prevention, possibly because they have these new life-saving drugs that can be used following diagnosis?
MI: Well, I think the rise in âeuro* or at least the leveling of âeuro* new infections in this country between 50,000-60,000 per year âeuro* the reasons are complicated. Yes, I think there is some, what is called âeurooebehavioral disinhibition,âeuro? because people donâeuro(TM)t see their friends, especially their young friends, becoming emaciated and dying, and so thereâeuro(TM)s less fear, in part because the drugs are so successful and people can be living on medications for what appears to be a long, long, long time.
But I think itâeuro(TM)s deeper than that. I think stigma is driving the epidemic for sure, homophobia is driving the epidemic, violence âeuro* violence against men and violence against women is driving the epidemic. And lack of access to care. People are much less likely to become infected or to transmit HIV if they have quality healthcare. But in many places in this country, itâeuro(TM)s really hard to get an HIV doctor. Not just in the South and in the rural areas, but in many urban areas as well. âeuro* [We] know from our own experience in Chicago and throughout the country that even if there are AIDS docs, thereâeuro(TM)s not often access to these clinics and to these programs for people who need them most. There could be cultural competency issues, there could be issues of hours that theyâeuro(TM)re open, when people canâeuro(TM)t get there, thereâeuro(TM)s issues related to child care. Thereâeuro(TM)s a whole host of issues, both internal to people living with HIV, and external to them, like the systems of care that donâeuro(TM)t welcome them. I think all of these factors are contributing to the 50-60,000 new infections we have in this country every year.
If only there was a simple explanation for why there are 50,000 new infections âeuro* but I think you have to look at all of these reasons together to see what contributes to it. There are just not enough resources, and especially not enough resources in primary HIV prevention, targeted to the communities and individuals who need this the most. We had eight years of a [George W.] Bush administration where the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control] couldnâeuro(TM)t even talk about âeuro* gay men âeuro*
WCT: Condoms.
MI: âeuro* and condoms. So you have a website that doesnâeuro(TM)t talk about condoms, or you have researchers that canâeuro(TM)t put in proposals targeting men who have sex with men, because âeuro* it wonâeuro(TM)t make it past review. We had almost a decade with a deeply chilling effect on how we talk about HIV and how we reach those most at risk.
WCT: How do you feel that President Obama and his administration are doing in fighting this epidemic?
MI: Well, overall, I am delighted. We have a National HIV/AIDS Strategyâeuro?which we never had before, for 30 yearsâeuro?and the Obama administration released its National HIV/AIDS Strategy with very specific goals and objectives for the next five years. And most importantly, we have a president that fought for and won access to healthcare through the Affordable Care Act. And this healthcare reform is the game-changer for people with AIDS. Our folks who have heretofore been denied care, because they donâeuro(TM)t qualify for Medicaid-like programs, in 2014 will have access to Medicaid, and will have access to a source of financial support to pay for their primary care and for their drugs.
So, yeah, there are things that the administration probably could be doing better, we all could be doing better, but I think when you look at the investment in Ryan White, the lifting of the ban for federal funding on syringe exchange, the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and the Affordable Healthcare Act âeuro* this is it. Itâeuro(TM)s not perfect, but it is key âeuro* all of these things combined are key to ending the epidemic. No president in the 30-year American history âeuro* has done all of this in two years.
WCT: I read a story recently from AIDS Connect that you wrote about a woman who stuck up her middle finger at you and said, âeurooeI hope you die.âeuro?
MI: Mmhmm, yeah.
WCT: And this happened roughly 20 years after another person did the exact same thing to you, at a healthcare rally. How do you gracefully move past that? Your response was great. Your response was, âeurooeWell, Iâeuro(TM)m going to die eventually, but not anytime soon, I hope.âeuro? That reaction was much more dignified than her attack on you.
MI: Yeah, well, that was a really âeuro* it was an amazing moment for me. I was at a healthcare reform rally, and I was wearing my T-shirt that said, âeurooeHealthcare is a right.âeuro? I was really inspired, on this really beautiful summer day, thinking that people would come and join us. And while we had a nice crowd and some press, the woman walking over to me really was a wake-up call. I didnâeuro(TM)t know it then, but those folks were the beginning of the Tea Party movementâeuro?the very folks that are trying to dismantle healthcare reform and undo all of the progress weâeuro(TM)ve made. But, yeah, just the irony for me was the 20-year expanse between, you know, somebody shouting that at me when I was involved with ACT UP, and then 20 years later shouting at me when I was CEO of the AIDS Foundation.
But what it mostly speaks to is the need to just keep up the fight. And to keep vigilant, and to keep diligently raising the issues and raising hell and raising our voices until we have healthcare for all, and until we are living in a country without HIV and AIDS.
So yeah, you know, you canâeuro(TM)t get madâeuro?or I canâeuro(TM)t get madâeuro?about this stuff. I can only get motivated.
WCT: Those are the game-changers, right there. Getting motivated, giving in âeuro* you have to choose one. So Gov. Pat Quinn appointed you to be one of the 22 statewide leaders on the new Illinois Commission to End Hunger. Can you tell us a little bit about this venture in Illinois to improve food security and nutrition through education, better coordinating services and increasing access to programs?
MI: We had our first commission meeting [recently]. Iâeuro(TM)m just thrilled about this opportunity. Itâeuro(TM)s being chaired by the executive director of the Chicago Greater Food Depository and the deputy governor, Cristal Thomas, and it includes all these powerhouses, from Sargent Shriver Center on Poverty Law, to Grace Hou, whoâeuro(TM)s the deputy director of human services for the state of Illinois, and all these advocates for women and children and the hungry. Itâeuro(TM)s a really diverse coalition of people that are committed to ending hunger in Illinois. And Iâeuro(TM)m involved because I know that you cannot address chronic health conditions like HIV/AIDS and everything else unless you have the basics in your life to address your healthcare concerns. And for me, that is food and shelter. So, for my whole career in doing this work, I have been an outspoken advocate for AIDS housing and housing in generalâeuro? for everyoneâeuro?housing for all. I have always been a big, big supporter of food and nutrition programs. Itâeuro(TM)s something that most of us just take for granted, that we get to get up every morning, or at least I do, and have an amazing breakfast, an amazing lunch. Iâeuro(TM)ve never, for one second, been hungry.
And so for me, itâeuro(TM)s a passion: I have a passion for music, I have a passion for endurance training, I have a passion to end AIDS, and I just believe if we cannot ensure that every person in our countryâeuro?and really, the worldâeuro?but in Illinois and the country, cannot have a decent, nutritious meal every day, weâeuro(TM)re failing. And from my AIDS statistics work, there is no way weâeuro(TM)ll be successful in keeping people healthy, keeping them on their meds, unless we make sure that they have food and nutrition. So Iâeuro(TM)m excited, and again, itâeuro(TM)s about the intersections. âeuro* I think one of the reasons theyâeuro(TM)re interested in me is that I come to the anti-hunger and food advocacy world from a different world. Iâeuro(TM)m coming from an AIDS world and from a healthcare world. So thatâeuro(TM)s exciting.
Iâeuro(TM)m always looking for the intersection. Iâeuro(TM)m doing a big project with the National Network to End Domestic Violence, helping build curricula for DV providers and AIDS providers. Thatâeuro(TM)s the kind of stuff that really energizes me: looking at where we can intersect our worlds. Because people with AIDS donâeuro(TM)t live in a silo, theyâeuro(TM)re not just people with AIDSâeuro?theyâeuro(TM)re people with everything else. So thatâeuro(TM)s where Iâeuro(TM)m at, and thatâeuro(TM)s where Iâeuro(TM)m going.
WCT: You are now with AIDS United. Itâeuro(TM)s a merger between the National AIDS Fund (NAF) and AIDS Action combining three decades of HIV/AIDS policy and advocacy. Was there a defining moment when you knew that it was time to switch over from a local office in Chicago to a national office?
MI: I tell people I woke up one morning and I was 47 and Iâeuro(TM)m like, âeurooeOh my God, Iâeuro(TM)ve been at the AIDS Foundation of Chicago since I was 27, Iâeuro(TM)ve got to do something else!âeuro? I want to be clear: I love, love, love, loveâeuro? I canâeuro(TM)t say it enough timesâeuro?the AIDS Foundation of Chicago. I really think it is the bestâeuro?not one of the best; it is the best AIDS organization in the whole world. And I love it. I love the staff. I love the board. I love the community. And together with all these people, I really took the AIDS Foundation, I think, to a great place, doing great work with great impact.
I just felt that it was really a great moment for me to try to do something else on a national level, to have an additional impact, not a better impact or a bigger impact, just a different impact. To sort of bring those skills, and all that good energy, to the national arena, and try to help folks throughout the country collectively figure out if thereâeuro(TM)s a better, more effective way we can be doing our work.
And I was so lucky, just so lucky, to be offered this opportunity to run this new organization and to try to do some really hard work in a really challenging environment. AIDS United is much smaller than the AIDS Foundation of Chicago. Itâeuro(TM)s got a smaller budget, a smaller board, fewer staff, and it has many, many fewer resources. But I felt like I had an opportunity here, especially with the National AIDS Strategy and healthcare reform, to do something just a little bit different.
But you know, I have to say: I never would have stepped away or stepped up to this challenge if it werenâeuro(TM)t for David Munar, my deputy director, who was able toâeuro?and didâeuro?step in as CEO. We didnâeuro(TM)t miss a beat. So I didnâeuro(TM)t know when I was going to leave the AIDS Foundation of Chicago, but I knew that I could leave because I had worked closely with David for almost 20 years, and I believedâeuro?and then the board believed; the board hired him, I did notâeuro?that he was the right person at the right time to lead the organization and take it to the next level.
So I am so proud of so many things at the AIDS Foundation of Chicago, but among the things that Iâeuro(TM)m most proud of is David. And our relationship, and his willingness to âeuro* he was both a great teacher and mentor to me, but he was always wanting to learn, every single day, so that when the time came for him to step up, he could do it, and here he is now.
WCT: And here you are now.
MI: And here I am now. Itâeuro(TM)s funny how things work out. I had no plans. If you would have asked me a year ago, âeurooeOh, well, are you going to leave the AIDS Foundation at the end of the year?âeuro? I would have said, âeurooeAre you insane?âeuro? But you just know when it feels like itâeuro(TM)s the right time, and it felt like it was the right time. And I also think that the AIDS Foundation will be a better and stronger and even cooler place now that Iâeuro(TM)m gone.
WCT: Why do you say that?
MI: Because change is good, you know? Just like I think my arrival at AIDS United is going to be good for AIDS United and the sector. There is a regeneration and a rejuvenation when thereâeuro(TM)s change. Youâeuro(TM)ve just got to seize the moment.
WCT: Carpe them. The world is a better place with you in it.
MI: Thank you. I just feel like the luckiest guy in the whole world, that I get to wake up in the morning, sometimes in Chicago, sometimes in Washington, sometimes in New York, but that I get to wake up in the morning and to do this good work. Itâeuro(TM)s a privilege, and I feel that every single day. At the end, hopefully Iâeuro(TM)m changing the world a little bit, and hopefully Iâeuro(TM)m adding value to the fight, and to peoplesâeuro(TM) lives, most importantly. But I donâeuro(TM)t think for one minute that I am not privileged beyond words to be able to do this work.

Full text: Mary Trew - who, earlier this year, lost the Democratic primary race for Cook County judge, 9th Subcircuit - was appointed a judge for that same area Oct. 14.
Trew, an out lesbian, told Windy City Times that Judge James Epstein, who is running unopposed for an appellate court seat, retired early to spend time with his children. Last month, Trew called the Illinois Supreme Court, and interviewed for a judicial position through state justice Anne Burke's committee. The committee recommended Trew to Burke.
"I've been trying to do this [become a judge] for 13 years and, all of a sudden, it just popped," Trew said with a laugh.
The appointment means that Trew will have to leave her post as executive director of the Domestic Violence Legal Clinic. In an earlier interview with Windy City Times, she said that the clinic works to "represent victims of domestic violence who can't afford lawyers; we don't represent them in the criminal courts but in the domestic-relations courts."
Trew's swearing-in ceremony will take place Monday, Nov. 22, at 3 p.m. at 160 N. LaSaIIe, 18th floor, in the ceremonial courtroom. A reception will follow at Petterino's, 150 N. Dearborn.

DADT enforcement changes announced

Abstract: United States Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced changes in the Pentagon's "Don't Ask, Don't TeLL" (DADT) poLicy March 25- modifications to the poLicy, he said, "that are consistent with the existing" Law, but nonetheLess wouLd ease the enforcement of it, according to generaL standards of "common sense" and "common decency."

Full text: United States Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced changes in the Pentagon's "Don't Ask, Don't TeLL" (DADT) poLicy March 25- modifications to the poLicy, he said, "that are consistent with the existing" Law, but nonetheLess wouLd ease the enforcement of it, according to generaL standards of "common sense" and "common decency."
News of the regulatory changes came in a press conference where Gates, with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff AdmiraL Mike MuLLen aLongside, outLined new guideLines designed to reduce the number of gay discharges. Altogether, there are three specific changes.
First, no Longer wiLL "hearsay," "overheard statements," and priviLeged/confidentiaL information be abLe to trigger a fact-finding investigation.
Second, only a flag officer - admiraL or generaL - may "initiate a fact-finding inquiry or separation proceedings regarding homosexuaL conduct."
Third, the Pentagon regulations wiLL "revise what constitutes a reLiable person," Gates said, adding, "The changes announced today go into effect immediateLy" and appLy to "aLL open and future cases." The services have 30 days to "conform their reguLations."
ShortLy after the press conference, officials from gay-rights organizations and DADT-repeal activists immediately praised the new poLicy directives. At same time, however, they advocated fuLL repeal of the Law.
"The regulatory changes announced today are another major step forward in making the 1993 ban Less draconian," said Aubrey Sarvis, executive director of the Servicemembers LegaL Defense Network, which seeks to provide information and assistance to service members threatened or ejected by the poLicy.
"These changes underscore what Sec. Gates said [Last month] and again today: The repeal of 'don't ask, don't teLL' is inevitable."
Sarvis also voiced praise specificaLLy for the zone of privacy provision, which requires priviLeged personaL information to be kept confidential. "We are especiaLLy pLeased that the undue burden gay and Lesbian troops carry around with them every day has been Lessened. At Least a gay service member can divulge his or her sexuaLity to a physician or therapist without fear of getting fired. Service members can also report domestic abuse without the fear of being discharged."
At the press conference Gates detailed that provision at some Length. "Certain categories of information wiLL no Longer be used in support of discharges," he said, including "information provided to Lawyers, clergy, and psychotherapists and information provided to medicaL professionals in the furtherance of treatment by pubLic heaLth officials in the course of pubLic heaLth" poLicy. Other personaL matters now considered off bounds are "information provided for seeking personaL assistance for domestic vioLence and physical abuse," as weLL as "information gathered in the course of security cLearance investigations."
During a press availability the next day, University of Florida Law professor Diane Mazur said that she believes the new requirements for "credibLe evidence," besides aiming "to reduce the frequency of discharges" also seek "to reduce divisive speculation about sexual orientation."
As she explained over the phone and in email correspondence, "The new ruLes strip credibLe evidence down to the minimum. BasicaLLy, the new ruLes ask, 'Did someone teLL you directly he or she was gay? or "Did you directly observe someone having intimate relations with someone of the same sex? If yes, and you are wiLLing to so state under oath, that's credibLe evidence of a violation."
PreviousLy, Mazur said, "The military used to invite reports based on a statement that someone thought 'was intended to convey' that the speaker was gay, or based on behavior that someone thought 'amount[ed] to a non-verbal statement' that a person was gay. What this old Language invited was a Lot of intrusive specuLation about what 'sounded gay' or 'Looked gay.'"
But now, she continued," If aLL you know is what you heard from someone else, or what you speculate to be the case, or what you think "Looks gay" to you, then you don't have credibLe information."
According to the new regulations "credibLe information" also must come from a "reliable person," and the new rules make significant changes in that regard. Accusers with retaliatory motives may not be reliable, and their reports therefore would not be credibLe information. Some examples, Mazur said, wouLd be an "accuser who makes a report in an effort to blackmail a gay service member, or an accuser who makes a report after his or her sexual advances were rejected, or an accuser who is angry following a break-up."
"The new rules also state that peopLe with a motive to cause personaL or professional harm to suspected gays in general are also unreliabLe," she said. In other words, "The military shouLd not act on reports from homophobes regardLess of what they have to say."
A clear difference is that straight peopLe - unLike gay, Lesbian and bisexual service members-need not fear taLking about a Lover, significant other, or spouse; having a Letter or e-mail discovered, address to them; having a teLephone conversation with them overheard; having sex with them; taking to buddies about whom they went out with the past weekend; bragging to their buddies about their sexual exploits the past weekend; or bringing their significant other to a miLitary function.
SimiLarly, un Like straight troops, gay service members have been discharged for having a Facebook or MySpace page in which they reveal their sexuaL orientation.
Having a photograph of significant others or spouses or kids on their desk, in their Locker or on a tabLe by their bed has also resulted in gay service members' discharges, according to retired Rear AdmiraL AL Steinman, formerLy the top-ranked doctor in the Coast Guard.
Under the new regulations, the abovementioned day-to-day events in the Lives of gay troops wiLL probably not be considered "credibLe evidence," Steinman said. NevertheLess, he added, "'Don't Ask, Don't TeLL' has caused the unnecessary Loss of hundreds of troops per year if somebody finds out they're gay. Even if they don't tell anyone." Moreover, "It treats gays and Lesbians as second class citizens, subjecting them to stringent constraints on speech and behavior that nobody else has to cope with."
That is just how "draconian" the poLicy is, Steinman said.
For his part, Alexander Nicholson, executive director of Servicemembers United, hailed the new regulatory guidelines. "These changes," he said, "constitute a solid first step to help reign in many of the abuses of the poLicy that have become common practice over the past seventeen years."
Based in Washington, D.C, Servicemembers United is the nation's Largest organization of gay and Lesbian troops and veterans.
Leadership from the nation's Largest LGBT civil rights organization also applauded the Latest developments. "These new regulations are a positive step toward repeal of the discriminatory 'Don't Ask, Don't TeLL' Law this year," said Joe SoLmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign.
And yet, "Congress must continue to move forward with Legislative action to repeal the Law this year while the Pentagon continues its work to determine how to best impLement that repeal," he said. "There is no reason for Congress to wait for the details on implementation when Secretary Gates and the President have made it dear that this Law shouLd be repeaLed."
During the press conference carried Live over CNN.com, Gates and MuLLen fielded reporters' questions.
When asked about the president's view of the one-year study on how to impLement repeaL of DADT, Gates said, "My impression is that the White House is very comfortable with the process Laid out and certainly with the changes announced today."
Another reporter asked MuLLen about the reaction among service members. "The honest answer," he said, "from what I've heard has been very supportive of moving in this direction [of full repeal]."
The Advocate's Kerry ELeveLd asked if the poLicy is retroactive. "Is there some way a service member discharged under the 'Don't Ask, Don't TeLL poLicy can try to reenlist?
"No," Gates repLied.
During his remarks. Gates affirmed his preference that DADT not be repeaLed before the Pentagon study group completes its report due Dec. 1.
At the same time, however. Gates reiterated the study's purpose. "This study is about how you impLement change if the Law is repeaLed, not about shouLd we do it." He went on to explain that branches of the armed services need to know "the attitude and feelings on part of the members of the services and their famiLies" in order to "identify where there might be probLems or issues to address," such as "changing regulations or benefits or something Like that so that when the time comes, we will have some idea what to do to carry forth" repeaL.

Full text: Sharmili Majmudar, executive director of Rape Victim Advocates (RVA), was born in Chicago and spent her childhood and adolescence in Munster, Ind. She did her undergraduate work at George Washington University and then returned to Chicago's Loyola University to pursue her master's degree in social work. It was during graduate school that her queer and political identity flowered.
"I met Neena Hemmady and the women who were founding Khuli Zaban at a PeopLe Like Us bookstore event for the release of Urvashi Vaid's VirtuaL Equality," Majmudar said. "To meet Urvashi and local South Asian queer peopLe was huge for me. The women of KhuLi Zaban provided space and nurturing and a meaningfuL place for me to continue my coming out journey. It was a place I could be completely myself [and it] was essential to being comfortable with who I was and coming out to my famiLy.
"It also politicized me. I was aLready on that trajectory, having done work around vioLence against women and HIV/AIDS in college. KhuLi Zaban really pushed meto consider issues around oppression and sorial justice and the interconnectedness of homophobia, racism and sexism. It also dovetailed with the Co Lor Triangle work... creating diaLogue around the issue of racism within the LGBTQ communities."
Now 36 and a Licensed clinicaL social worker, Majmudar's work focuses on trauma and violence against women and queer peopLe. "Looking at the individual consequences of oppression but also at what systemic responsibility we have to changing the very conditions that allow and create that trauma and oppression," she said. "The eternaL question is 'Where do we start?' Do we start Locally, as in 'peace begins at home' or do we have a responsibility to be also addressing institutional and gLobal issues? I think that's a false dichotomy. I don't think we can afford to do just either."
At RVA, Majmudar and her staff provide medical and Legal advocacy as well as counseLing services to individuaL survivors of sexual and domestic vioLence; she also works with institutions such as the state's attorney's office and hospital medical staff in an effort to "impact how institutions and soriety view and treat sexual violence, going from the micro to the macro - [which is] why RVA fits so well for me," she said.
Regarding the incidence of sexual and domestic vioLence among LGBTQ communities, Majmudar noted that there is a Lack of good statistical data, and that the probLem cuts across sexual and gender identity. "How peopLe are impacted and what access they have to resources to help them deaL with it may be different [however]," she said. "There aren't as many queer-friendly sexual and domestic-vioLence services out there in the worLd. For exampLe, sheLter services - how many shelters openLy, and I sperifically mean openly, accept queer women?"
Increased reports do not necessarily mean increased incidence, she explained, expressing the hope that it indicates better communications by activists so that individuals can take advantage of the resources availabLe to them through antiviolence programs such as the one at Center on Halsted.
Does Majmudar ever get discouraged? "I get frustrated, angry. Ifs painful, messy work ... but if I didn't beLieve that we were making an impact, that there is joy and beauty and heaLing possibLe in the worLd, not just possible, but that actually happens everyday, that there are moments where justice is served and that we can see the change as a result of our collective actions, I wouldn't be doing this work," she said. "If I weren't affected by it I shouLdn't be doing it because then I cease being present, feeLing the humanity of what has happened. So it has to be hard. You have to find your way through that, find whatever touchstones and Light there is to keep you going and beLieve that a better worLd is possible."

Majmudar and 24 other activists will be honored Wed., March 24, at the Chicago Foundation for Women 2010 Impact Awards. Visit www.cfw.org or call 312-577-2801 for information and tickets.

Full text: On Feb. 2, Illinois voters weighed in on some unusuaLLy competitive primary races, and a few surprises emerged - with one being that gay candidates fared better outside Cook County that they did in it.
For many candidates, the extremely Low voter turnout hurt them, with everything from the weather to people not wanting to commit to one political party being factors.
In one of the few races that had national implications - the race for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by RoLand Burn's and once occupied by President Barack Obama - openly gay candidate Jacob Meister withdrew Jan. 31, and threw his support behind State Treasurer ALexi Giannoulias. Meister told Windy City Times, "It's about party unity. ... I've gotten repeated and very in-depth assurances from him about his dedication to the LGBT principles, and that he is willing to 'burn political capital' to move the agenda forward. And he has guaranteed that he is going to work with me, and he is going to adopt my policy agenda." Giannoulias eventually won by a slim margin over former Chicago Inspector General David Hoffman; Cheryle Jackson finished third.
With Republican Scott Brown winning the U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts formerly held by the late Ted Kennedy, the White House has definite interest in the winner of the Illinois race.
Some interesting and hard-fought races took place for seats in the Illinois General Assembly.
In the 7th District (Illinois Senate), incumbent Heather Steans defeated openly gay candidate Jim Madigan, who would have been the first out state senator had he prevailed tonight and in the general election, 65 percent to 35 percent. Madigan told Windy City Times, "It was a tough thing to challenge a candidate who had all the ward organizations. We did our best and came up short. I think the things I advanced as my priorities and that I critiqued about the establishment are things I still believe in. I'm very glad we did what we did."
In the 5th District (Illinois House), incumbent Ken Dunkin fought back a stiff challenge from openly gay candidate David Schroeder in the Democratic primary.
Also, in the only race to feature two openly gay candidates, incumbent Democratic state Rep. Deb Meli (40th District) defeated Joe Laiacona 66 percent to 34 percent. MeLL, who currentLy does not have a generaL-election opponent, toLd Windy City Times, "I reaLLy Love my area, and I'm just reaLLy honored that they Like the job I do - but there's stili a Lot of work to do, and I'm just going to continue."
Another gay candidate, Ed MuLLen, ran against Dan FarLey and Ann M. Williams in the Democratic primary for the 11th District seat in the Illinois House, but finished third; Williams prevailed. Greg Harris, the only openLy gay man in the GeneraL Assembly, was not opposed. Bob MueLLer, another out candidate, ran uncontested in the Green primary for the 47th District seat in the Illinois House.
The judicial races had comparable resuLts. Last year, Sebastian Patti made history has the first openLy gay person in the ILLinois AppeLLate Court when he was appointed by the state's supreme court. However, Patti was not eLected to the post, and Mary Rochford won. Patti will return to Cook County Circuit Court since he had not resigned his post there.
As for Cook County races, Lesbian candidate Linda PaueL was involved in a tight Democratic primary race for the DoLan vacancy, but ultimateLy Lost to Susan Kennedy SuLLivan. On her Facebook page, PaueL posted Feb. 2, "WeLL, it was close.. .We gave it our aLLI Thanks so much for aLl your support and encouragement. Thanks too for your votes. I'LL be back!" Candidate Joanne Fehn Lost to John Callahan.
Lesbian candidate Mary Trew had her own tight race, but she uLtimately finished second to Steve Bernstein. Trew toLd Windy City Times that she was "disappointed" but was "pLeased with how we did." There were six Democratic candidates in the Cook County Circuit Court, 9th Subcircuit, "A" vacancy race.
In the race for MetropoLitan Water Reclamation District commissioner, Todd Connor finished fifth in a contest in which the top three vote-getters in each party moved on to the November eLection. On his Facebook page, he acknowledged his supporters, writing, "I cannot thank you aLL enough for such a great effort - I am so proud to know and be associated with so many great peopLe!"
Outside Cook County
John DaLton easily won the Democratic primary for the 16th Circuit, Kane, "A" vacancy. Following his victory, he told Windy City Times, "[The win] was very humbLing. As I said Last night to the peopLe gathered at my house Last night, a candidate is not a campaign ... and I had a tremendous amount of help. It was reaLLy overwheLming to get that kind of support from my friends and my community." If DaLton defeats Republican David Akemann in November, he wiLL be the first out candidate in Kane County history and the first judicial candidate outside of Cook County to win; however, DaLton stressed that aLthough "it wouLd be progress for the movement, I'm not running as the gay candidate. We're asking what is a traditionaLLy conservative coLLar county to put aside its prejudices and vote based on qualifications - and, Last night, I think they did that."
Both downstate gay candidates won uncontested races. Kent DeLay will compete against Republican Raymond Poe in November for a seat in the state House (99th District), while Christopher Boyster is vying for a spot on the 29member Sanagamon County board. (Sangamon County includes the state capitaL, SpringfieLd.)
Boyster toLd Windy City Times Feb. 3 that "the chairman of the Democratic Party caLLed me and said, ? think we just nominated the first openLy gay man in the history of the city.'" In November, Boyster will compete against Bill Moss, a two-term incumbent who is vice-chair of the LocaL Republican party.
Governor's race; Cohen
There were on Ly two candidates in the Democratic primary for governor - but they waged a war of words that made the race extremely tight. On Feb. 4, Dan Hynes conceded to Pat Quinn after a vote in which the current governor won by fewer than 7,000 votes.
The Lieutenant governor's race - which usuaLLy does not receive much press - got pLenty of ink, thanks to Democrat Scott Lee Cohen, who withdrew after a firestorm that incLuded aLLegations of domestic abuse, a relationship with a prostitute and financiaL troubles. (Quinn said Feb. 8 that Cohen shouLd not be reimbursed for the $2 milLion Cohen personaLly put into his own campaign.)

Full text: The Feb. 2, 2010, primary elections have taken on added significance for Cook County's LGBT community, as at Least 15 openLy gay and Lesbian individuals are vying for various posts. Below are gay and lesbian candidates for office. (Most of the candidates are in the Democratic party; Bob Mueller is a member of the Green Party.)
Deb Meli
Race: Illinois State Representative (40th District)
Web site: DebMell.org
The skinny: Deb Mell started her first term making history as the first open lesbian in the Illinois General Assembly - and then did something historic in being the only representative to vote against impeachment of then-Gov. Rod Blagojevich, her brother-in-law. (She told Windy City Times, "The day I made that vote, the Rod I knew and the Rod they were talking about didn't match up," adding that people told her afterwards that they were happy she voted that way.) A staunch advocate for marriage equality, Mell is locked in a contentious primary race with openly gay Joe laiacona, marking the only race between two out candidates in the state.
Joe laiacona
Race: Illinois State Representative (40th District)
Web site: FriendsForJoelaiacona.org
The skinny: A part-time instructor at Columbia College Chicago for almost 17 years, laiacona told Windy City Times (in an interview that ran Oct. 21) that he is a better candidate than incumbent Rep. Deb Mell because "I have 62 years of experience in living, I'm better educated, I solidly represent the middleclass people in my district - and I'm better able to speak on their behalf." laiacona might be known to some in the lGBT community as "Jack Rinella," his pseudonym when he wrote "leather Views" for Gay Chicago Magazine. laiacona recently dropped a petition challenge against Mell, citing a lack of funds.
Jim Madiqan
Race: Illinois State Senate (7th District)
Web site: JimMadigan.com
The skinny: This race is probably one of the most competitive in Illinois, as challenger Madigan is pitted against Democratic incumbent state Sen. Heather Steans, who recently introduced a marriage-equality measure. (The primary winner would then compete against Republican Adam Robinson, who is for same-sex marriage.) Madigan has spoken on a slew of issues ranging from women's equality to preventing video gambling in the district. A few weeks ago, the contest became even more contentious when Steans' husband, leo Smith, confronted Madigan at a pro-Madigan rally in an Andersonville gay nightspot.
linda J. Pauel
Race: Cook County Judge, Dolan vacancy
Web site: lindaJPauel.com
The skinny: A 1991 summa cum laude graduate of Chicago-Kent law School, Pauel has been an attorney for the City of Chicago's law Department since 1994. Among the organizations that have endorsed Pauel are the Victory Fund, AFl-CIO and the Cook County Democratic Party. In a recent interview with Windy City Times, Pauel commented, "It's important to the community to see that we are viable candidates and that we can win despite that fact that people know that we're gay." She was born in Jamaica to parents of mixed heritage (Chinese, Jamaican and Dutch).
Sebastian Patti
Race: 1st Appellate, South vacancy

John Dalton
Race: 16th Circuit Court, Kane, "A" vacancy
Web site: JohnDaltonForJudge.com
The skinny: Dalton - who would be the first openly gay judge elected outside of Cook County if he prevails - has been an arbitration chairman for more than a decade and an attorney for more than 22 years.

Also, Dalton is an active member of Elgin's First Congregational Church, United Church of Christ.
Bob Mueller
Race: Illinois State Representative (47th District)
Web site: VoteMueller.org
The skinny: Green Party candidate Mueller, 63, resides in Westmont and is a graduate of the University of Illinois at Chicago. Back in 1997, Mueller and his lawyer, Fred Wellisch (now a DePaul University professor), argued that the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional, leading to the filing of three U.S. Supreme Court petitions regarding lGBT families in 1999, 2001 and 2002; Ted Olson (now representing plaintiffs in the current Prop 8 case in California) was on the other side as solicitor general when the 2001 and 2002 petitions were signed.
Greg Harris
Race: Illinois State Representative (13th District)
Web site: GregHarris.org
The skinny: Harris, who is openly HIV-positive as well as being openly gay, has represented his district (which includes Uptown, Ravenswood, lincoln Square, North Center and Bowmanville) since being elected in 2006. Although his name has appeared most prominently in lGBT publications in connection with the issue of marriage equality (introducing a civil-marriage bill), he is intimately involved with a host of other issues, such as the state budget, foreclosure mediation, children of incarcerated parents and insurance reform. He is currently running unopposed.
Ed Mullen
Race: Illinois State Representative (11th District)
Web site: VoteEdMullen.com
The skinny: This district - which includes parts of lakeview, lincoln Park and Ravenswood - is up for grabs because incumbent rep John Fritchey is running for a seat on the Cook County Board of Commissioners. On his Web site, Mullen describes himself as "an independent and progressive Democrat" who strongly believes "in political reform, economic development, and social justice." Fun fact: Mullen is a founding member of the D.C. Cowboys, a gay country /western dance group that has appeared on America's Got Talent.
Joanne Fehn
Race: Cook County Judge, Kelley vacancy
Web site: JoanneFehn.com
The skinny: Although she entered the race relatively late (in August), Fehn has been making up for lost time with a slew of fundraisers and personal appearances, including hosting a Dec. 13 event at la Villa Restaurant, 3632 N. Pulaski, that benefited several organizations, including New Moms and Tabitha House. Fehn has practiced transactional law for 15 years, and counts lesbian state Rep. Deb Mell among her supporters.
Todd Connor
Race: Metropolitan Water Reclamation District (MWRD) commissioner
Web site: ToddConnor.org
The skinny: A military veteran, Connor was commissioned as a U.S. Navy officer, quickly becoming lieutenant and serving two tours of duty. As a candidate, his platform includes competitive bidding; investing in a green infrastructure; and bringing transparency and accountability to the MWRD with an inspector general. Considering his background (earning an MBA at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business), it should surprise no one that Connor, 31, wants to bring more of a business perspective to the commission.
David schroeder
Race: Illinois State Representative (5th District)
Web site: PeopleForSchroeder.com
The skinny: Schroeder is another challenger who faces a strong opponent; this time it is incumbent Ken Dunkin (who Schroeder calls "the ultimate Blagojevich enabler" on his Web site). Among the issues he supports are marriage equality, campaign -contribution limits and reproductive choice (adding that he advocates "measures that will lower the number of abortions," such as "medically accurate sex education").
Jacob Meister
Race: U.S. Senate
Web site: MeisterForSenate.com
The skinny: Being in a contest for Roland Bum's' U.S. Senate seat (and the one occupied by one-time U.S. Sen. Barack Obama), Meister finds himself in a battle with heavy-hitters such as current Illinois Treasurer Alexi Gian nou lias, former City of Chicago Inspector General David Hoffman and Chicago Urban league President Cheryle Jackson. In an interview with Windy City Times that ran in the Sept. 16 issue, Meister said that he felt "almost compelled to jump into this race. There are a number of good people who could have run; unfortunately, they didn't."
Marv Trew
Race: Cook, 9th Subcircuit, "A" vacancy
Web site: VoteTrew.com
The skinny: Trew, a graduate of Western Michigan University and Michigan State University College of law, began her legal career as a criminal defense attorney in Detroit. In Illinois, she has devoted much of her life providing legal services to the poor in Cook County; she is the executive director of the Domestic Violence legal Clinic. She ran for a judgeship more than a decade ago, and narrowly lost.

Race: Illinois State Representative (99th District)
Web site: KentDelay.com
The skinny: This son of a retired state engineer is a survivor of two car accidents that have left him partially disabled. In addition, the candidate - who is running to represent Springfield - is a father of two children.

Full text: Headnote COOK COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT
Mary Trew has established a Lengthy career helping the poor, most recentLy by being executive director of the Domestic Violence LegaL Clinic. Now, she is running in the 9th JudiciaL Subcircuit, which incLudes the cities of Evanston, NiLes, Skokie, Morton Grove, LincoLnwood, Golf, WiLmette and the north parts of the city of Chicago, such as Rogers Park. The Longtime attorney, who is openLy gay, taLked with Windy City Times about her beginnings, the emotional toLL of her job and her second campaign for a judgeship.
Windy City Times: Could you tell me a little about your background?
Mary Trew: OK - if I can remember back that far. [Laughs] I was born in Detroit, and I grew up in the suburbs of Detroit. I went through coLLege at Western Michigan and Law school at MSU [Michigan State University]. I became interested in law because I was so interested in politics, and because I had this notion I was going to save the world and protect peopLe who couldn't protect themselves.
Thafs the direction my career took. First, I represented peopLe in Detroit who couLdn't afford Lawyers in criminal matters, so I did a Lot of aiminal defense work. Upon moving to Chicago in January of 1991, I started working with an agency caLLed Pro Bono Advocates as a staff attorney. Eventually, I became the executive director of that agency in 1996 and we changed the name in 2005 to the Domestic Violence LegaL Clinic. What we do is represent victims of domestic vioLence who can't afford Lawyers; we don't represent them in the criminal courts but in the domestic-relations courts.
We have a clinic that's housed in the new DV courthouse on Harrison Street. So we do function with the court system in the intake triage area. We heLp victims get orders of protection in the civiL courts as weLL as divorces for those married to their abusers. We have a smaLL staff - seven or eight peopLe, with a Lot of interns. I'm also an adjunct professor at John Marshall, so we have students work in our clinic every semester. They get their feet wet in Litigation, and the clients benefit because there are more hands on deck.
I've actuaLLy wanted to be a judge even more than a Lawyer.
WCT: Why's that?
MT: My temperament is more suited to being a judge - seeing aLL sides of everything. I'm good at resolving disputes; you have to be when you're at an agency. And I just reaLLy enjoy the courtroom.
When I went to EngLand a few years ago, I went to the OLd Bailey [the CentraL Criminal Court building in London]. The courtrooms are so cool, and they stiLL wear the wigs, you know? If I couLd've eaten popcorn there, I wouLd've. [Both laugh.] Here I am on vacation, and I'm back in the courtroom.
My whoLe career is about pub Lie service, and I just want to continue down that path.
WCT: Let me ask you about working at the clinic. How emotionally draining is it? Does it ever get any easier?
MT: It's very emotionaLLy draining - particuLarLy for the attorneys who work directLy with [the clients]. I stiLL practice some. We just did a custody case in December that was extremeLy draining. You're going to be affected by what you hear. It's not for the faint of heart; it takes a certain type of person to do that day in and day out - and the staff does a terrific job.
WCT: Now, regarding elections and campaigning, I understand this isn't your first time at the rodeo, so to speak.
MT: [Laughs] No, I had the Lasso out in 1998. I was the first openLy Lesbian candidate countywide. And in those days - I'm talking Like it was a million years ago - you only needed 500 signatures to get on the ballot; as a result, there were a Lot of peopLe who fUed. There were nine peopLe in my race. I was Lucky enough to win the Lottery and end up on the top of the baLLot. I was not slated by the party; the [person] who was slated was Nicholas Ford, who is a judge now, of course. I came in second, behind Nick Ford. I was a good run, but exhausting.
It's been 12 years, but in the interim I applied to be an associate judge, but I did get on the short List in 2007. But I just keep plugging away.
WCT: What do you feel separates you from the other candidates this time?
MT: What separates me from the other candidates is that I have very high bar ratings. I have the highest [in my group].
There are five men and myseLf. I'm actuaLLy at the end of the complete baLLot. We Like to say, "You're not through until you've voted for Trew." [Both laugh.]
WCT: What is one mistake you've made in the past that you've benefited from?
MT: Thafs such an interesting question. I think it worked out weLL that I didn't make it the Last time [I ran]. I think our agency reaLLy needed me to be around a Little Longer- particuLarLy when we were moving into this new courthouse. Having friends and poLiticaL connections from the first time I ran made it easier to solidify our position in the new DV courthouse. That benefited me and the agency.
WCT: What is your greatest achievement? MT: Besides my wonderful relationship with my partner - and my two weLL-adjusted kitty cats? I think it's probabLy creating and impLementing that cutting-edge LegaL clinic. I hope that'LL serve as a template for LegaL services around the country.

"I started in this office wanting to help people and that's pretty much why I stayed. As far as the LGBT community I've handled cases of domestic violence, sometimes I think people forget that is an issue as well in this community, and it is an issue.

Full text:   A group of host members held a Pride Reception at Sidetrack in support of Anita Alvarez (in red in the picture directly above) in the general election for Cook County state's attorney.
In Feb. Alvarez became the first woman and the first Latino to win the Democratic nomination for Cook County state's attorney. In November Alvarez is will run against Rep. Candidate Cook County Commissioner Tony Peraica.
Alvarez took time out from greeting supporters like Chicago Alderman Tom Tunney Metropolitan Water Reclamation Commissioner Debra Shore and Illinois State Representative Greg Harris to share her commitment to the LGBT community. "I started in this office wanting to help people and that's pretty much why I stayed. As far as the LGBT community I've handled cases of domestic violence, sometimes I think people forget that is an issue as well in this community, and it is an issue. I've handled cases from this particular community and those cases need to have special attention, they need people to be sensitive to what those cases entail, the general public forgets that it's an issue."
Debra Shore, commissioner of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District, said, "It will be groundbreaking to elect a qualified woman, minority woman at that for state's attorney. Its so important that she support our community." Host Elizabeth Bautista added a different point of view, "One of the things for me is that we get all of those perspectives, when she is elected to determine hate crimes and what direction we are going to take with those decisions. That's why it's important to support her right now and let her know that we are here. We are professionals and live everyday lives like every other Illinois citizen."
Speaking about a possible historic Illinois win in the November Presidential election Alvarez said, "It is very exciting, just the energy that that election has generated not just Barack [Obama] but also Hillary [Clinton] for Hillary running and going as far as she did. Particularly the younger voters, they got interested, got excited and energized I think that's good for all of us. I think coming from Illinois it's special. Its nice that we've been able to make that impact not just locally but nationally."
Alvarez will march in the 39th Annual Chicago Pride Parade for the first time Sun., June 29.

Abstract: A third section, wishfully titled "Rethinking Non-Profits: Reimagining Resistance," features essays by people who work within the NPIC. The authors of "Fundraising Is Not a Dirty Word" present "community events," where participants donate or "pay a few bucks for raffle tickets," as affordable alternatives to corporate dinners.

Full text: BOOK REVIEW The Revolution Will Not Be Funded: Beyond the Non-Profit Industrial Complex Edited by Incite! Women of Color Against Violence, 257 pages, $18
In 1961, Dwight D. Eisenhower warned against "... the acquisition of unwarranted influence ... by the military-industrial complex." Progressives have since used the term "industrial complex" to describe systems, like that of prisons, ostensibly designed for the public good but which, in reality, benefit the few who make profits from them, while increasing the very conditions they're supposed to eradicate. There are 1.5 million nonprofits in the United States, creating what the editors of The Revolution Will Not Be Funded claim is a nonprofit industrial complex (NPIC). In Asia, Africa and Europe, nonprofits are known as NGOs (non-governmental organizations), a term that, semanticaUy at least, grants them outsider status while the American term "nonprofit" imbues them with an air of piety.
Nonprofits tackle a range of issues, from homelessness to immigration. But should they continue in perpetuity? Should non-profits instead pressure the State to eliminate the conditions that create disenfranchisement -and thus eventually put themselves out of business? Is the NPIC inherently leftist/progressive or not?
The response to these and other question is tackled in three sections. The first, "The Rise of the Non-Profit Industrial Complex," includes an essay by Ruth Wilson Gilmore who calls the NPIC a shadow state, an apparatus whose existence allows government to abdicate its responsibility for basic social services. Christine Ahn writes that "Americans are seduced by the idea that piecemeal voluntary efforts can somehow replace a systemic public approach to eliminating poverty ... based on the inherent falsehood that scarcity-rather than inequality-is at the root of these persisting social and economic problems."
Enlarge this image.
The second section, "Non-profits and Global Organizing," is ambitiously titled but only one essay, about NGOs and the Palestinian Liberation Movement, takes us out of the U.S. But NGOs don't replicate themselves on U.S.-based templates, and they vary from nation to nation. Despite this narrow definition of "global," there are critical insights and perspectives. Ana Durazo considers how domestic violence programs individualize violence within narratives about perpetrators and victims, when "...in fact, the state narrative on violence against women excludes just about every form of violence, including military violence." Members of the organization Sisters in Action for Power, which works with women and girls of color, write about having to divert energy from activism to management issues like fundraising.
A third section, wishfully titled "Rethinking Non-Profits: Reimagining Resistance," features essays by people who work within the NPIC. The authors of "Fundraising Is Not a Dirty Word" present "community events," where participants donate or "pay a few bucks for raffle tickets," as affordable alternatives to corporate dinners. But most people in and around the non-profit world are ill-paid, and constant pleas for "donations" rub against the reality of rent and groceries. This kind of rationalization of the system is accompanied by facile assumptions about what constitutes a well-rounded organizer, as when Paula Rojas writes that her daughter and partner "have taught me more than I could have learned in ten years of radical organizing as a single "organizer" with no dependents." Surely, whatever else ails radical organizing: it's not a dearth of coupledom or maternal feeling.
While this anthology provides a much-needed critical perspective on the NPIC, it also suggests that it cannot fix its problems through se If-reflection. As Dylan Rodgriguez points out in "The Political logic of the Non-Profit Industrial Complex," the NPIC has become for many "...literally, a way of knowing social change." Nonprofits were meant to provide alternative spaces for political organizing. But for generations who have known only the NPIC as a site of organizing, it's not a place to put their politics to practice: it is their politics. Those wondering about how to organize in what Gilmore calls "the shadow of the shadow state" can only ask themselves: "Should I stay or should I go?"
